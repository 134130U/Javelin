This purple-tinted Carignan is a concentrated number with familiar varietal and regional aromas of latex, graphite, schist, tire rubber and black fruits. In the mouth, this is chewy and full bodied, but not heavy. Oaky spicy blackberry and nutmeg flavors linger on a mildly woody, extracted and gritty finish. Best to give this a few more years so drink through 2022.
