This wine comes from a small appellation that specializes in botrytized wines. This mature wine with its honeyed touch (as well as lemon and ripe botrytis) is luscious and opulent. It has a smooth generous and full texture. There is a bitter-orange-marmalade flavor that gives a crisper edge at the end. This beautiful wine is ready to drink.
