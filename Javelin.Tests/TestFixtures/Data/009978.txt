Nearing brown in color, this blend of 60% Viognier and 40% Chardonnay is reminiscent of a Old Fashioned cocktail, with orange rind and bourbon notes as well as walnut oil and quinine aromas. A strong hazelnut-oil character shows on the rougher palate, which is thick and oily with dried apricot and more orange peel.
