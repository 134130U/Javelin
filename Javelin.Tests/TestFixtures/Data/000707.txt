Boosted with 5% Barbera, this bottling for the estate's Bootjack Ranch shows ripe cranberry, red cherry, a pinch of herbs and touches of caramel and coffee syrup on the nose. A dense core of black plum skins at the palate's core is surrounded by bright cherry fruit, evolving into a dark chocolate and espresso touch.
