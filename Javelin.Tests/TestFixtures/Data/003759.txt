Wood smoke and black pepper aromas start this full-bodied wine out with a bang. Lively, spicy blackberry and black cherry flavors contribute richness on the palate, accented with toasty, savory, meaty overtones. Add its moderate tannins, and the overall effect is a generous, complex and interesting wine.
