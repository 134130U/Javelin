Black-plum and apple-skin aromas are fruity and a bit raw. In the mouth, this blend of Cabernet Franc, Syrah, Carmen√®re and Petit Verdot is full, properly tannic and loamy in feel. Dark-leaning flavors of licorice, peppery spice, chocolate and herbs finish with classic Chilean notes of black olive and tobacco. Drink through 2019.
