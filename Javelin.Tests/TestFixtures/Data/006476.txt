This wine sources fruit from throughout Napa Valley, as well as 9% from Lake County and 1% from the Sierra Foothills, incorporating all five red Bordeaux varieties and a smidgen of Syrah. It's juicy in black currant, with a tension of acidity and a smooth, simple focus, aged in both French and American oak.
