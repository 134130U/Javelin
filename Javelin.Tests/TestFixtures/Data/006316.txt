While dry and delicate in body, this intense, penetrating Riesling is lush with sun-drenched peaches. A steely, mineral tone lends gravitas to the midpalate, finishing lean, elegant and bright. Enjoy now for its exuberant youth, but store some away to enjoy as its minerality intensifies from 2020 on.
