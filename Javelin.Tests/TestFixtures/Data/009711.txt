Chalk, apricot honey and wisps of gasoline lead the aroma profile on this wine from electronic music DJ David deLaski and his wife, Anna. The couple have been making wine since 2012 with the help of Steve Clifton (of Brewer-Clifton & Palmina wines). On the palate, there is strong mandarin orange-driven acidity and remnants of the chalkiness, which together should give the wine aging potential. Drink today or buy a case and try every year to track what will be an insightful evolution.
