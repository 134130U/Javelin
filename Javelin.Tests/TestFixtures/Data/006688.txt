Stalky black cherry and cedar aromas are persuasive enough, but this Crianza also comes with less impressive scents of wet dog and burnt black fruits. Big, tannic and rough on the palate, this tastes of earthy plum, black pepper and bitterness. A drawing, tannic finish brings additional burnt, roasted flavors.
