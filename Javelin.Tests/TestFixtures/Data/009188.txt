A terrific effort, the 2010 Terre Ferme is a full-bodied, velvety-textured wine with a long, multidimensional finish. It's pungent and savory upfront in its aromas of clove and allspice, but raspberry undertones add another layer of interest and those grace notes are all underscored by the powerful bass duo of black olive and espresso. Drink nowâ€“2025.
