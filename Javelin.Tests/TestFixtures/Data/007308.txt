Four decades of experience shine on this Josh Jensen bottling, which mixes luxuriously ripe wild berries, raspberries and cola with the sharper spice of sweet clove and dried violet. It's bright with acidity, picking up licorice in the midpalate and finishing on a tart, slightly bitter note of crushed cranberry. This will sip well for a few years but is amazing now.
