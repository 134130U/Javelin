Dark and dense, this is sourced from the winery's own Sacrashe property in the hillsides of Rutherford, as well as Bergfeld Vineyard. The wine has a concentrated and jammy quality that doesn't step over the edge. It offers anise, blackberry, black currant and dried herb around a soft, rounded mouthfeel and long finish. Enjoy 2021â€“2026.
