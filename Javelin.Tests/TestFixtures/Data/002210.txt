Aromas of dark berry, violet, vanilla and a whiff of toast lead the nose on this bright, sleek red. Made from 70% Sangiovese and 30% Merlot, the firm but accessible palate delivers sour cherries, black raspberries, cocoa and dried aromatic herbs alongside zesty acidity and fine-grained tannins. Enjoy through 2017.
