A barrel selection from estate-grown grapes, this Pinot succeeds in rich red raspberry and an offering of strawberry-rhubarb pie, the texture velvety smooth. The oak builds through the finish, providing ample body and substance, yet the wine stays light and lilting on the palate, inviting one in for more.
