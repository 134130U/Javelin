Aromas of red berry, brimstone, white pepper, Mediterranean herb and a whiff of leather come together in the glass. The creamy palate offers wild strawberry, juicy cherry, cinnamon and savory herb alongside bright acidity and firm, polished tannins. It's vibrant, with compelling tension. Drink 2015â€“2022.
