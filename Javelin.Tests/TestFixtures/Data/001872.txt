Soft, subdued, savory and subtle, Old Kraft dates back originally to the 1860s, much of its plantings traceable to the 1890s. Zinfandel and Petite Sirah populate the gorgeous pocket of a site, a stone's throw from Spottswoode. Blackberries and raspberries figure prominently, alongside intrigues of cinnamon and clove, a forested note not far behind.
