From 7.5 acres of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a rich wine, very perfumed and with layers of ripe fruit. It is lightly structured, full of red berries with a firm tannic character in the background. Under winemaker Olivier Dauga, the wine needs to age but has all the fruit potential there. Drink from 2018.
