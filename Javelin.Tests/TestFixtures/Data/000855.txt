Damp sagebrush, dark cranberry, buttered black cherries, fresh plucked marjoram and wet stone show on the nose of this bottling. The tip of the sip shows great thyme, bay leaf and anise character, then settles into rich cranberry fruit, all held together by a decent tannic grip. The dark fruit flavors linger deep in the finish.
