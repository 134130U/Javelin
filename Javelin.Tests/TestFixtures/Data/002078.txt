There's no denying that this is a heavily oaked Rioja with toast, resin, vanilla and cheesy aromas alongside fully ripe blackberry and prune notes. There's energy to the palate, while previously mentioned heavy oak spawns flavors of vanilla and spice to go with berry fruit. A mouth-coating, woody finish stands out on this compartmentalized Tempranillo-led blend. Drink through 2023.
