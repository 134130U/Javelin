This wine offers a lighter side of Petite Sirah. It conveys more red fruit than brooding black and blue, a taste of red licorice and lean, balanced red cherries sleekly layered over earthy plum and spice. Its structure and acidity make it food-friendly, ready to accent a black pepper steak or similarly seasoned roast.
