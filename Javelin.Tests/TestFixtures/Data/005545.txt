This wine is produced solely with Nerello Mascalese grapes aged in terra cotta vessels and made with no selected yeasts or added sulfites. It offers concentrated black cherry, raspberry and licorice flavors accented with cracked black pepper and smoky mineral alongside big but velvety tannins. The warmth of alcohol marks the close.
