A whole host of aromas interest here: black and red cherry, fresh earth, lifted conifer and a touch of mocha. The palate is concentrated and has a lovely texture of starched velvet. This echoes aromatically and has a vein of brightening freshness at its core. There is warmth and a huge generosity of fruit that is utterly moreish.
