Produced with consultant Hubert de Boüard of Château Angélus in Saint-Emilion, this wine is complex, impressive and packed with red and black fruits. It has a fine juicy character as well as a dry core of tannins and wood aging. It could probably do with some more aging and will be better from 2018.
