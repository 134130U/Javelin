The first thing that leaps at you on this oddball blend of Albillo, Sauvignon Blanc and Viognier is toasty oak, which overrides spice and apple aromas. In the mouth, this is full, resiny and grabby. Oak-driven flavors of vanilla, lees, peach and white pepper finish long, with elegance and a woody aftertaste.
