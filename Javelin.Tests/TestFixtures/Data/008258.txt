A blend of Scooteney Flats and Kiona vineyards, this 100% varietal wine initially brings barrel-forward aromas of vanillin, clove and spice. This evolves over time to reveal dark plum and pepper. The fruit flavors are fleshy yet still show restraint. If the barrel notes integrate, it could move up a notch.
