Named after the lords of Hattstatt—a word that evolved to Hatschbourg—this wine comes from selected grapes. It's a medium sweet, rich wine with a smooth structure and opulent texture. Lychees and yellow fruits are cut with lime acidity to balance ripeness and freshness. It's a wine to age, drink from 2018.
