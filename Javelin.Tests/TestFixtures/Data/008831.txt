Made from 80- to 100-year-old vines, this compelling, earthy wine initially opens with funky aromas that burn off in the glass to reveal leather, tilled soil, blue flower and ripe berry. The palate delivers black and red cherry accented by white pepper, cinnamon and black pepper. With firm but velvety tannins, give this a few more years to let it fully  develop; drink 2016â€“2026.
