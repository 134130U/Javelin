This bold wine has a very dark color and fresh, concentrated blackberry aromas. Generous berry and black pepper flavors seem to saturate the taste buds, leading to a lingering fruit and spice finish. The texture is almost viscous, as lots of fine tannins add grip. It's the rare wine with no added sulfites.
