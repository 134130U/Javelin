Ample aromas of blue flowers, dark-skinned berry and a whiff of baking spice come together in the glass. Made entirely with Sangiovese aged in large oak casks, the warm palate doles out dried black cherry, anise and dried herb alongside fine-grained tannins. It's shy on freshness so drink through 2016.
