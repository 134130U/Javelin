Tight and fresh aromas of Asian pear, honeysuckle and key lime pie converge on this sparkler from a new estate in Temecula. The palate shows sliced apples, yellow pears, ripe nectarine, rounder white peach and even creamy cherimoya flavors. Though the region is known more for almond-flavored sparklers, they seem to do regular bubbles well.
