This densely textured, deeply flavored wine showcases the beauty of old vines in Amador terroir. It has an opaque color, opulent clove, blackberry and cassis aromas, and ripe, jammy flavors that drench the palate yet are supported by tannins firm enough to keep it balanced and appetizing. Best after 2020.
