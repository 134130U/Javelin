A 100% Cabernet Sauvignon from one of Sonoma County's newest appellations, a district that spans Sonoma Valley's eastern ridges near Napa's Mount Veeder. Cross Creek Vineyard has long been the source for this winery's Cab, a fresh, juicy taste of black fruit with managed tannins and hints of mint chocolate.
