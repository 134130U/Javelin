This single-vineyard offering opens with aromas of blue flower, tilled soil, ripe berry, balsamic notes and a hint of leather. The palate is still young and needs time to develop fully but already delivers layers of dark cherry, licorice, grilled herb and black pepper alongside brooding tannins. Drink 2016â€“2026.
