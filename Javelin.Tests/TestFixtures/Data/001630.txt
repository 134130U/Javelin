The Napa-ness of this Pinot makes it so interesting. Grown in a warmer climate, it's dry, soft and somewhat herbal, with red currant, cola, tea, cranberry and mushroom notes. It feels complex in the mouth, without the flash and dazzle of more coastal bottlings, but there's a lot going on. Drink nowâ€“2017.
