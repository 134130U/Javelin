Wonderfully mellow and lifted flavors of ripe, aromatic apple rise from the glass. The same pure apple notes also play on the palate where they are pervaded by a zesty lifting freshness. This is precise and bone-dry, but the full expression of the tangy apple fruit gives this great richness and an clean finish.
