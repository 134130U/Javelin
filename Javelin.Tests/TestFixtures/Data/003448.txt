Blended from Muns Vineyard near the mountaintop and Wiedemen Ranch near the base of the appellation, this bottling offers cola, black plum, Concord grape and dried rose petal scents on the complex and elegant nose. The flavors are layered and woven on the palate, evoking elderberry, charcoal and purple flower touches.
