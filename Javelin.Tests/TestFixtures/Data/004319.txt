It has been a while since we've reviewed Cuatro Pasos, but eight vintages later it's basically the same wine, which, for the price, means good value. This opens with earthy warm muddled berry aromas. The palate is flush and plump, reflective of a hot vintage, while blackberry and cassis flavors finish hefty. Drink now.
