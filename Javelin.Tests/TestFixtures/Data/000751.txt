Concentrated aromas of blackened oak, blackberry, cassis, licorice and hickory smoke are clarion calls that this is a fully oaked, modern wine. In the mouth, it's heavy and tannic but doesn't trip over itself. Blackberry, cassis, burnt toast and campfire flavors finish equally toasted, peppery, charred and lemony, with chewy tannins. Drink through 2020.
