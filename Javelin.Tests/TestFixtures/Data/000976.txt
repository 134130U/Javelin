Planted in 1988, this vineyard 's fruit captures the unique minerality found in this AVA. It leaves an impression of sucking on rockâ€”not a bad thing in a wine. The black-cherry fruit grips the palate with real power and some density, with potent herbal highlights as well. Drink this now through the mid-2020s.
