This excellent boutique brand is slowly expanding, doubling the production of the estate wine in 2014, and adding two new vineyards to the mix in 2016. Consistent from vintage to vintage is the elegance and depth of detail, beginning with subtle, entwined fruit flavors of raspberry and cherry. Hints of dried herb, cigar box, and a touch of chocolate come up through the finish. The tannins are proportionate, though still a bit astringent, suggesting a few more years of bottle age would be beneficial.
