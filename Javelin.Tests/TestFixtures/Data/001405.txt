This is a smooth, easy-drinking and rather light-bodied wine, not unusual in the tricky vintage of 2011. Relatively light in color, this offers scents of sweet cherry, vanilla and cinnamon, while the flavors recall cherry and raspberry. The texture is almost delicate but livened up with a good touch of acidity.
