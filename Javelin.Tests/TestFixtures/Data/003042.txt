This is a perfumed ripe wine, packed with generous tannins that still give a style and elegance that is a remove from the older overripe style of Pavie. It is balanced, complex and with great potential. The wood and the tannins are in harmony with the black fruits. With its structure, it will certainly age well. Drink from 2027.
