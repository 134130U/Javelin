This wine is dark garnet to the eye, offering aromas of pomegranate, juniper berry and bell pepper. Overpowering tannins remain in the forefront of flavors of cooked cherry, pine needles, cassis and mint. While the tannins never feel to recede on the palate, there is a sensation of the faintest splash of brightness on the finish.
