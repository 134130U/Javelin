Gisborne wines are poorly represented in the U.S., but this is a good introduction. Mouthwatering scents of bergamot, hickory smoke and peach lead the way, followed by similar flavors on the palate in this medium- to full-bodied wine. Hints of cashew and underripe pineapple creep in on the crisp finish. Drink now.
