Electric-pink color and piercing acidity add to the unique personality of this bold angular Cabernet Franc rosé. Tart sour-cherry and raspberry flavors are pristine and primary, but nuanced with lingering hints of bramble and savory herb. This is a refreshingly substantive style of rosé to enjoy with even heartier fare well into the fall months.
