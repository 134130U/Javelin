Not overly full-bodied, not overly ripe, not overly wild, but just right for dinner time. It's well balanced, velvet textured and multilayered. Brambly, bright raspberry and blackberry flavors fill the mouth, supported by smooth tannins and good acidity that keep it lively and appetizing through the long finish.
