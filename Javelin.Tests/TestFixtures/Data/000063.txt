L'Homme Mort is a northern extension of the Fourchaume Premier Cru vineyard, so called because this was where a local lord dispensed justice by death. It often produces cooler wines such as this. It is tight, with toasted bread hints and with a strongly tangy character. It does need to develop and shouldn't be drunk before 2018.
