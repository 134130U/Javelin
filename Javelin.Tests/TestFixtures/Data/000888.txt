Pure Merlot from the Stillwater Creek Vineyard, this finished its fermentation in concrete egg, then spent 20 months in 100% new French oak, and another two years in bottle prior to release. Tightly wound and dense with cherry and chocolate layered throughout, it brings in flavors of red licorice and baking spices. The tannins are silky and the structure and flavors are bold.
