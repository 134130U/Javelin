Lush ripe aromas of earthy black fruits and graphite open this varietal Graciano from a warm vintage. Hefty and chewy in feel, this tastes of fudge cake, blackberry and cassis. A lasting stout finish offers tobacco and prune flavors. Yes, this is huge. But there are very few Gracianos that offer this kind of power, flavor and intensity. Drink through 2023.
