The lift of heady aroma precedes the pear-fruited and herbal tisane-scented nose. The palate is gentle and has that same herbal softness. The fruit is rich with residual sweetness and characterized as ripe pear. This is balanced by zesty, pleasantly bitter citrus. The effect is of harmonious, gentle and generous balance. This mature Pinot Gris is now perfectly Ã  point. Its flavors linger long and pleasantly.
