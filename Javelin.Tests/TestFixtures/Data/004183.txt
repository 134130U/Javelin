With tight, crisp aromas of berry fruit, toast, mineral and mint, this Cabernet Sauvignon blend is high tonedâ€”coming across racy and snappy. Jumpy, lively plum and raspberry flavors are backed by leafy, herbal notes and resiny oak. A spicy mint finish concludes this energetic yet oaky blend. Drink through 2021.
