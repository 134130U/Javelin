Composed cherry, cassis, tobacco and oak aromas are elegant and on the spot. This is alert on the palate, with bold acidity and moderate tannins. Lightly herbal plum and cherry aromas are earthy and leafy but not green. A rugged-feeling herbal finish suggests Cabernet Franc, but this is 100% Cab Sauvignon.
