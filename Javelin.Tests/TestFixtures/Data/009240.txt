It's rare to find this variety in Pinot-heavy Russian River Valley, but this producer treats it with respect, crafting a minuscule amount of worthy flavor, the 100% Petite Sirah awash in velvety tannins that tease in coconut and vanilla. Soft oak is supported by smoky leather, chocolate and blackberry, a dustiness completing the picture.
