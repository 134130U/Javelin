There's a dense core of floral fragrance as well as cola and black olive touches on the nose of this tightly wound wine, which needs ample time to open. Bright and pure purple fruit meets lilac flavors on the palate, its density buoyed by balanced acidity. Over time, touches of herb and spice emerge.
