Made from a majority of Cabernet Franc, this wine is blended with 11% Cabernet Sauvignon and 1% Syrah. The fruit comes from the winery's estate vineyard in Rutherford as well as from Stagecoach Vineyard in Atlas Peak. Initially smoky, it reveals pockets of cedar and herb before unleashing juicy black cherry, chocolate and dusty, big tannins.
