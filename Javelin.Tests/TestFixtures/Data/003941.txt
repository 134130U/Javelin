This wine is from the Riddle Ranch above Occidental, a cool, coastal village strongly influenced by the Pacific Ocean. Reduced on the nose, it offers brightly woven raspberry and strawberry flavors, rounded by sizable, firm tannins and a midpalate girth that finds relief in rose petal and zesty allspice notes on the finish.
