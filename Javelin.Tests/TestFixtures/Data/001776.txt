Earth, leather and strong but quality oak notes accent berry-fruit aromas. Cheek-sucking tannins make for a rugged mouthfeel. Spicy, peppery berry flavors are fully oaked and toasty, while this tastes dry and minty on the finish. Grilled meat and/or a few years on its side is what this needs. Drink through 2025.
