Cassis and elderberry scents pair perfectly with tobacco and loamy dust aromas in this serious blend of 32% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Merlot, 25% Cabernet Franc, 6% Petit Verdot and 6% Malbec. Tobacco accents the black fruit on the palate as well, with dill, anise and charcoal touches. It's firmly structured and bone dry.
