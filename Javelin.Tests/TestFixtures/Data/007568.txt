Aromas of new wood, coconut and roasted coffee beans lead the nose of this blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. The bracing palate offers oak extract, prune, pomegranate, powdered sage and espresso alongside assertive, astringent tannins that dry out the finish. It lacks the fruit richness needed to stand up to the oak.
