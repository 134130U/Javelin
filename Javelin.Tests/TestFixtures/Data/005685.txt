The nose gives little away and is very shy. The palate, however, is a paradigm on lemony freshnessâ€”of textured candied lemon and pear richness and great concentration. All of the richness of Pinto Gris is present, but it is carried aloft by zesty citrus freshness to strike a note of harmonious tangy balance. The finish shimmers with pear, earth and spice.
