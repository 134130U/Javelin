This plump Pinot Noir uses 20% new French oak to deliver nutmeg, gingerbread spice and licorice aromas. Black cherry and raspberry round out the nose and integrate on the palate, which is hearty and rich in Christmas spice and crushed rock notes. An excellent choice for anyone seeking a full-figured Pinot.
