Sumptuous peach comes across as almost overripe. There certainly is opulence on the rich almost oily palate. Flavors are very concentrated and have edges of caramel and barley sugar, but these are balanced by freshness and a pithy welcomed bitterness. This finishes medium sweet with lingering flavors of both zest and peach.
