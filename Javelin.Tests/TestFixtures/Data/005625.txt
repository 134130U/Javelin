This blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Merlot, 13% Petit Verdot and 7% Malbec is warm and inviting on the nose, with baked blueberry, caramel, vanilla and violet touches. The palate continues its purple flavor theme with a core of blueberry fruit, but dried herb and mocha spice provide more complex layers.
