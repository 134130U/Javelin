Despite its varietal label, this drinks more like a Bordeaux-style blend with the Cabernet Sauvignon (11%) and Cabernet Franc (9%) showing themselves prominently. Coffee, flower, dried herb and red- and black-fruit aromas are followed by elegant, lightly creamy fruit flavors that carry through the finish.
