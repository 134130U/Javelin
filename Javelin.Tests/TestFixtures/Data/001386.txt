Pretty aromas suggest plum, red berry, leather, graphite and eucalyptus. The understated palate isn't as expressive as the nose, but reveals subdued black cherry, black pepper, espresso and oak. Astringent tannins still need to integrate, but for now leave the mouth feeling dried out. Drink after 2020.
