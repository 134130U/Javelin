This creatively labeled bottling by Herman Story alum Chris Kiranbay uses 70% whole cluster fruit to produce a complex nose bursting with strawberry, kola nut, mulberry, elderflower and maraschino cherry aromas. The palate starts with mulberry fruit, growing more serious as it opens, with slate-inflected textural tension, finishing on cinnamon spice.
