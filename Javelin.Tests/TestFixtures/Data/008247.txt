Named after the Knights Templar who were headquartered in the Tejo region of Portugal in the Middle Ages, this estate has produced a fruity, soft and rounded white wine. It has an attractively aromatic character from the inclusion of Riesling and Moscatel in the blend. Wait until the end of 2015 before drinking.
