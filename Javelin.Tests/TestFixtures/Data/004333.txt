This rounded Chardonnay from winemaker Duncan Williams (also of Falkner in Temecula) shows creamy cherimoya and nectarine fruit, accented with cinnamon, clove and butter on the nose. The palate is delicate and supple, its salted almond and nectarine flavors riding a wave of vibrant acidity into the finish.
