Dark red cherry and baked red currant fruit meet a slightly meaty aroma on the tangy nose of this bottling from Chuck Carlson. It's lively on the palate, with punchy acidity and grippy texture, showing dried herb and tart red fruit flavors, making a strong case for growing Cabernet Franc in the region.
