This cofermented field blend is 60% Tannat and 40% Malbec. It's big, black, bold and captivating, with rich blackberry and boysenberry fruit. The tannins are grainy and flecked with graphite, and there's a suggestion of mocha throughout. This might fool some tasters if it were to be tossed into a blind tasting of high-octane Sonoma Zinfandels.
