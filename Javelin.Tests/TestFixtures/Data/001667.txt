This is a dark and concentrated wine, solid with dark plum skin tannins and a dense structure. A fresher side brings in spice and a tense texture of both freshness and acidity. It should age a couple of years more, so drink from 2017. The estate, about 31 miles from Toulouse along the Tarn river, has a well-recorded history of family ownership over many centuries and is now run by the Faramond family.
