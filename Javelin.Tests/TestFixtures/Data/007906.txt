A very dry and firmly tannic wine, this doesn't give up much aroma, and the flavors also seem bound up with the astringent texture. With a bit of time some blueberry and blackberry aromas emerge, and flavors of black olive, too. This wine seems to require the most marbled steak to balance its austerity in texture, or perhaps 10 years in a cool cellar.
