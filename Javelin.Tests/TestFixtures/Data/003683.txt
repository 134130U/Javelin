From White Hawk Vineyard near Los Alamos, this wine has a nose that is both edgy with tangerine rind and ripe with warmer crème brûlée notes. The palate plays the same trick, welcoming with broad white peach, Japanese pear and vanilla-cream flavors, yet clinging to a zesty line of lime pith throughout.
