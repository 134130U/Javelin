This wine is a blend of fruit from Quintessence, Red Heaven, Fidelitas Estate and Shaw vineyards. The aromas are wound up tightly at present but with coaxing reveal notes of French oak spices, black cherry and black currant. The flavors show a surprising amount of restraint, with a pleasing cranberry tartness and a lick of tannins.
