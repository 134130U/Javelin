Evoking green grape, peach, honeysuckle and ripe melon, this Muscat's aromatic profile is as enticing as ever, all wrapped in a slender, absolutely dry and light-footed package. Full of rich flavor without the attendant weight, it embodies the scent and joy of summer and finishes on a refreshing note of zesty lemon.
