The power and richness of Port fill this extreme—and extremely delicious—Zinfandel. It is very deep in color and vivid in aroma, like the scent of ripe grapes at the crusher on harvest day. It fills the mouth with apparent sweetness that lingers long on the finish. Perfect match for after dinner with blue cheese and toasted walnuts, or a cigar.
