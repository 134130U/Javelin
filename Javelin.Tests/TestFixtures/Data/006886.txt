Dense and delicious, this deeply colored wine opens with aromas of blue flower, plum, raspberry and graphite. The lively, savory palate delivers concentrated black cherry, cassis, white pepper and mineral before reaching a dry finish. Thanks to broad but fine tannins, it has a surprisingly solid structure for such an easy-drinking, enjoyable wine.
