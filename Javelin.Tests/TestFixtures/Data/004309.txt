Everything is in place in this medium-bodied, smooth-textured and generously flavored wine. It has a good blend of subtle cherry, blackberry and raspberry flavors, plus hints of spice from barrel aging. Well balanced for drinking now through 2018, it's made with 63% Zinfandel, 23% Petite Sirah and 14% Syrah.
