Finally, this wine has been brought to the U.S. There were only 40 cases imported, so it may be difficult to track down, but it's worth a search. It's light to medium in body, but with an expansive nose of toasted brioche. That note combines with hints of mixed citrus and tart berries on the palate, then comes to a clean, refreshing close.
