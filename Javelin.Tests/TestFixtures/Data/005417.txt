Though billed as a Super Tuscan, this is an odd but refreshing wine for those seeking something different. The Cab-Sangio blend offers strong black pepper, brambleberry, pink peppercorns and a touch of pasilla chile on the underripe nose. The palate is light in body but full of bright cranberry fruit and intriguing herbals, led by green peppercorns.
