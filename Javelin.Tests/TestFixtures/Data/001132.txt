Orange blossoms, night jasmine, ripe Pink Lady apples and a touch of bubblegum pop on the nose of this bottling from a coastal canyon vineyard behind Cambria. The palate shows a fine-tuned and textural grip, offering similar floral flavors as well as a botanical streak that shows a touch of pine needle and goes deep into the finish.
