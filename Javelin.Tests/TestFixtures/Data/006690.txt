Apart from a ripe blueberry scent, the nose of this Zwiegelt and Cabernet Sauvignon blend is shy. The palate presents juicy, cinnamon-tinged blackberry and black cherry fruit, with a lovely whisper of white pepper around the edges. A very successful wine for a very ripe vintage, it has the firm tannins of Cabernet to lend appetizing balance to all the juicy fruit.
