This brand is from the resourceful Don Sebastiani & Sons of Sonoma County. It's a great example of the company's ability to find superb fruit and raise it into fine wine, and then sell it at a fair price. The wine is rich and pleasurable in blackberries and cherries, with a fine overlay of smoky oak.
