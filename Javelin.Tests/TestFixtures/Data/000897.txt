This cloudy, amber-colored wine isn't for the faint of heart. Made from ancient Grecanico, Carricante and Catarratto vines on the slopes of Mt. Etna and aged in terra cotta amphorae, it's mineral-driven with intense flint, smoke, nectarine, citrus, ginger, white pepper and balsamic sensations supported by an acidic backbone. Boasting great depth and complexity, it evolves continuously in the glass.
