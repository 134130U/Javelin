This is an exceptionally concentrated, smooth and delicious wine. It has ripe blueberry, blackberry and raspberry flavors, and its texture strikes the right balance between supple and tannic. A Coro Mendocino blend, it's made from a base of Zinfandel, with Petite Sirah, Syrah and a dash of Grenache. Delicious now, it also has the stuffing to age. Best from 2018.
