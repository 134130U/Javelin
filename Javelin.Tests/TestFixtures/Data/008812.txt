This is an expertly balanced wine from Temecula, showcasing region's potential for Grenache. Rosewater, cherry juice and cherry blossom aromas are lifted by herbal touches of marjoram and crushed peppercorn. Fennel, thyme and oregano flavors kick off the palate, where strong acidity carries raspberry and red berry flavors into a complex and elegant finish.
