Carneros is one of the best places in California for Pinot Gris/Grigio. This 2013 shows the brisk acidity of the appellation, and also the excellence of the 2013 vintage. It's pure and rich in apricots, tangerines, white peaches and papayas, and yet the finish is dry and clean. There's no oak at all, nor is any needed.
