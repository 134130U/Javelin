Delicious blueberry, plum and cinnamon notes are still shy on the nose. The palate also holds them tight with pervading, lively freshness and a very slight spritz. White pepper spice colors the edges, making for an exciting, concentrated but light-footed wine that has rusticity and elegance in equal measure. Lovely now but sure to develop. Drink nowâ€“2025.
