A terrific value in sparkling wine, this slightly copper-tinged bubbly features classy aromas of dried thyme, citrus and apple. On the light-bodied palate, there's a hint of creaminess and the merest suggestion of strawberry, although apple and citrus dominate. A great option for summer entertaining.
