Crushed raspberry, blue flower, tilled soil and graphite aromas lead the nose on this firmly structured wine. It's still very young and needs to open up fully, but the palate already displays breeding and class. It offers ripe black cherry, ground black pepper, licorice and grilled sage alongside tightly wound but fine tannins. Drink 2018â€“2026.
