This is the producer's inaugural foray into the variety, sourced from the Oak Knoll area. The wine is inspired by the Loire Valley and its well-known Cabernet Franc. Coopered in French oak and stainless steel, it retains a subtle crispness and light body, the acidity supporting highlights of floral white fig, pear and honey.
