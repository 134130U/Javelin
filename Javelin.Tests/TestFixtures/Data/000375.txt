Made with 60% Moscato di Alessandria and 40% Albanello, this earthy, intriguing white offers penetrating aromas of pressed wild flower, vineyard dust, orchard fruit and dried aromatic herb. The pervasive floral scent follows through to the mineral-driven palate along with dried peach, candied nectarine zest and chopped sage. Quality has improved immensely since the producer transferred to her spacious new cellars.
