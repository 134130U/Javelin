The chateau owes its name to the 18th-century Joseph Laffitte who created the estate. The wine ,which comes from the heart of Saint-Est√®phe, is ripe with spice. With generous tannins and equally generous fruit, it is dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon that gives it the structure as well as the juicy fruitiness. Drink this fine wine from 2021.
