Fergie of the Black Eyed Peas produces this label with her father and winemaker Joey Tensley, whose handiwork unleashes aromas of white pepper, black cherry, a cornucopia of dark berries and earthy minerality. Bright acidity on the palate partners with blackberry soda flavors, quite racy for the variety.
