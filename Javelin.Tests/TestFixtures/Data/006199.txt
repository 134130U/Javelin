This unusual five-grape blend includes Chardonnay, Sémillon, Sauvignon Blanc, Viognier and Muscat. It maintains a sense of focus, with the grassy, herbal character of Sauv Blanc and Sémillon commanding most of the attention. It's stiff, woody (rather than oaky) and herbal. Try it with fresh goat cheese.
