This opens with a blast of resiny oak, but airing calms things down, and ultimately the bouquet is round and full, with a mix of wood, vanilla and tropical fruit aromas. This is chalky, minerally and full in feel, accented by apple, pear, melon and spice flavors. Leftover oak and savory spice flavors dominate the finish.
