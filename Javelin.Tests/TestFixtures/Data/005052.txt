Scorched earth, game, cured meat and leather waft out of the glass. The taught palate offers dried black cherry, pomegranate roasted coffee bean, anise and a vanilla note but not quite enough fruit richness. Tightly wound, grainy tannins leave an astringent finish. Give the tannins a few more years to unwind then drink.
