This is a fruit bomb supreme. Bright, effusive strawberry, raspberry and boysenberry aromas and flavors seem to spread out in all directions, first in the aroma, then repeating in the flavors and finish. With a sip or two some deeper black cherry notes emerge, and full body and gripping tannins become more apparent.
