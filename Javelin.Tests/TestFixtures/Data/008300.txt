This begins with a bucketload of dense and brooding aromas, from macerated plums and cherries to dark chocolate and melted black licorice sticks. It's soft and mouth-coating once sipped, with pronounced tannins on the midpalate, flavors of black cherry and olallieberry, a bit of tarry tension and minty sensation on the finish.
