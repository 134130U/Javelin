There was no oak used on this stainless steel-fermented Sauvignon Blanc, but it does contain a splash of Viognier. It's dry, crisp in acidity and savory in lime, orange, kumquat and vanilla flavors that finish long and clean. It will pair with everything from bruschetta with olive tapenade to fried chicken, Chinese food and sushi. Easy to find, with 190,000 cases produced.
