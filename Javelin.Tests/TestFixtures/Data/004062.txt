There's quite a bit of green on this nose of this blend of 63% Merlot, 24% Cabernet Franc, 10% Cabernet Sauvingnon, 2% Malbec and 1% Petit Verdot, with grilled jalape√±o most prevalent. The palate is not very dense though proves dynamic, showing red cherries and elderberries laced with green peppercorns.
