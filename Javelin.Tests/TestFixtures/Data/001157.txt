This blend of 71% Syrah, 16% Grenache, 8% Zinfandel, 3% Petite Sirah and 2% Mourv√®dre stands up to Paso blends three times its price. Broad aromas of plum, olallieberry and dried cherry mix with vanilla, dill and herbes de Provence on the nose. The creamy palate conveys boysenberry and blackberry seasoned by lavender and white pepper.
