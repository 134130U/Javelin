There is no lack of dark, smoky flavors in this 100% varietal bottling. Leather, cola, cassis, tar, burnt rubber and smoke all whirl about, with an underlying impression of dried leaves. The listed flavors may not stir you with longing when named in this way, but taken all together and accompanied by a bowl of beef stew, they will satisfy.
