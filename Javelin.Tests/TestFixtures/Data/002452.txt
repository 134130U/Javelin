Fresh and full of finesse, this radiant red offers rose, forest floor, woodland berry, new leather and pipe tobacco scents. The palate delivers juicy red cherry, crushed raspberry, wild herb and white pepper notes, finishing on star anise. Taut, refined tannins and bright acidity give it intensity, lift and balance. Give it time to develop to its full potential. Drink 2020â€“2032.
