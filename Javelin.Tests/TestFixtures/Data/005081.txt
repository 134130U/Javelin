This estate, dating to the 18th century and close to the Gironde estuary, has produced a rich wine. Young tannins and fine fruity acidity are both present in a wine that is serious and dense. Its weight, ripeness and the potential of the black-currant fruit will all allow it to age. Drink from 2022.
