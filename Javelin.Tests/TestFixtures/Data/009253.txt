Stoller's reserve reflects the specific vintage conditions while retaining a stylistic throughline. In 2012, it's dark and potent, with streaks of saline, fresh herb, black olive and tart cherry. A big wine, it opens nicely with breathing time, turning into a lush, generous mouthful, with notes of cola and spice.
