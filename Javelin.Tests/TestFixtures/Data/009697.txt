Glazed apple and pineapple sorbet frame the nose on this offering from Central Coast veteran Stephen Ross Dooley, who makes his wine in one of San Luis Obispo's only urban wineries. The wine is very full and soft on the palate, with round, traditional Chardonnay flavors and a satisfying balance between ripe, rich fruit and lingering acidity. The finishing flavors feel more oak-derived than acidity-fueled.
