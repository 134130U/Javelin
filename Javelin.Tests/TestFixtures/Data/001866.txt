From vines now a dozen years old, this unusual Walla Walla AVA Sauvignon Blanc is a brilliant straw colorâ€”aromatic with light scents of ripe grain and tangy fruits, and fills the mouth with delicious flavors of melon, white peach, lemon verbena and a dash of pepper. Complex and engaging, it finishes dry but leaves an impression of slight sweetness. Drink it slightly chilled.
