Aromas of menthol, toast, espresso and mature black-skinned fruit come together on this accessible, full-bodied red. The ripe, chewy palate offers cherries marinated in spirits, blackberry jam, vanilla and a confectionary note alongside velvety tannins. You'll also note the warmth of alcohol on the midpalate.
