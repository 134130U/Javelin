This is a great example of the power that can come a Grand Cru vineyard. It's opulent and dense, but more than that it has intense energy and drive. Although the wine is marked as medium sweet, the spice and pepper give it a dry, tight, nervy edge. The wine is still young and will be best from 2017.
