This medium-bodied wine has a compelling blend of restraint and power. It offers modest, fruity aromas at first, then nice tart fruit flavors that start off lean and soon expand exponentially in the mouth before tapering off elegantly on the finish. With little oak flavor in the way, it gives pure Pinot sophistication.
