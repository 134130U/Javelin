Aromas of blackcurrant, spice, menthol, espresso and a whiff of toasted oak lead the nose. The round, chewy palate doles out blackberry jam, licorice, ground black pepper and coffee alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. Showing the heat of the vintage, it's evolving quickly so enjoy sooner rather than later.
