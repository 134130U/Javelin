Made with 85% Merlot blended with varying amounts of Petit Verdot, Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of truffle, underbrush, baked plum and dark cooking spice. The palate delivers licorice, roasted coffee bean and blueberry extract alongside astringent tannins that dry out the palate. While the tannins are still aggressive, the fruit richness is starting to dry out.
