The intense floral fragrance suggests dog rose, broom, violet and perfumed berry. The vibrant, linear palate offers red cherry-berry, cinnamon, white pepper, Mediterranean herb, licorice and orange zest alongside assertive but polished tannins and vibrant acidity. It's beautifully balanced, with a mineral-driven finish. Drink 2017â€“2025.
