This is a serious wine with a lighter brighter side. Its wood aging adds spice to the ripe red fruits and brings out the concentration and intensity. It is, in its way, an unexpected side of Provence ros√©, emphasizing richness and complexity. But it all comes together: a fine wine that, after a year of aging, is ready to drink.
