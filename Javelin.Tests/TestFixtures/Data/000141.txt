A sublime twist of citrus lies at the heart of this light yet complex white, which is refreshing and layered with a subtle bite of underlying oak. From a dry-farmed vineyard maintained by the same family for 30 years, this whole-cluster pressed wine was given time in a majority of stainless steel and neutral French oak. It shines in moderate acidity and tropical flair.
