This cellar-worthy wine is enjoyable now, rich and powerful in bright red and blackberry fruit, spice, toast and black licorice. Concentrated and layered, the tannins are thick and interwoven, and the juicy texture offers balanced acidity. Streaks of chocolate and earthy menthol on the nose and palate give distinctiveness. Enjoy now through 2024.
