By rights, the Herrenweg vineyard in Turckheim should be a Grand Cru. Certainly in the hands of Zind-Humbrecht it behaves like one. This is a powerful, rich and totally spicy wine. It has weight and pepper in abundance, a complex wine that's full of ripe fruits and an opulent aftertaste. Drink from 2017.
