Aromatically, this varietal Prieto Picudo from Asturias shows graphite, wood resin, vanilla and spiced plum. In the mouth, however, it's devoid of structure and thus comes across jammy and flabby. Flavors of baked berry fruits are oaky and rooty, while this is massive on the finish but lacks foundation and framing.
