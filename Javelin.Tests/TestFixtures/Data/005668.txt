Smoky notes of roasted meat and white pepper spice up the plum skins and blackberry fruit that show on the nose of this bottling. The smoke is also prominent on the sip, where graphite minerality frames the blueberry and blackberry fruit. The character of slightly burnt balsamic reduction sauce also shows through.
