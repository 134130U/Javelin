Deep garnet to the eye, this wine has a nose of strawberry and tart cherry with a hint of resin. Flavors of cherry, pomegranate, eucalyptus, anise and a soft touch of leather are suspended in a web of well-moderated tannins. Expect a lasting sense of coolness with a burst of brightness on the finish.
