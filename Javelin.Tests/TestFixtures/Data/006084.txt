Underbrush, grilled herb, new leather and spiced plum aromas lead the nose of this chewy Brunello. The palate doles out juicy black cherry, raspberry compote, licorice and pipe tobacco notes, framed by robust, fine-grained tannins. Despite the powerful structure and hefty alcohol, it has elegance. Drink 2019â€“2027.
