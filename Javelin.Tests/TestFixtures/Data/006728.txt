This wine from the personal vineyard of the winery's co-founder has assertive woodsmoke, toasted oak and forest aromas, its bright black cherry and pomegranate flavors accented by tamarind and black pepper. While strongly oaky and firmly tannic in texture, it has a sleek and nervy aspect that's very appealing.
