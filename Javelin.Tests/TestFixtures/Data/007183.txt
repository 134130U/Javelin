This no-herbicide, hand-picked, hilltop Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon-Petit Verdot blend is rich with attractive acidity and ripe strawberry fruits. Its tannins present a structure for fruity texture. A wine from Bordeaux wine guru Professor Denis Dubourdieu's stable, it has concentration and a dense dark aftertaste. Drink from 2017.
