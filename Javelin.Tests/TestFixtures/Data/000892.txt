Reedy, berry aromas come with a shot of eucalyptus, which is very Chilean. A tight, tannic, dry palate is exact and intense. Flavors of leafy and slightly herbal black fruits are matched by licorice and coffee notes, while the finish is long, dry, snappy and loaded with earthy spice notes and hints of olive and mint. Drink through 2019.
