This wine's nose barely hints at ripe apple and white pepper, but the palate sings with aromas and flavors: fresh lemon, ripe and juicy red apple and a slightly herbal, grassy touch. All of this appears on a delicate, light-bodied frame enlivened by zesty acidity. The finish is long, intriguing and dry.
