This wine is red-violet in colour and has a nose of raspberry and fennel. There is a nice interplay of medium-weight tannins and bright acidity, with flavors of cranberry, tart cherry, chocolate and flint. The zesty finish is followed by the lingering presence of soft tannins on the tongue and gums.
