Located in Soussans to the north of the village of Margaux, the estate is owned by the Luze family. This is a fine wine, full of black fruits and firm tannins. It also has a softer perfumed side that is typical of Margaux. With this combination and the ripe berry fruits, the wine is sure to age well. Drink from 2021.
