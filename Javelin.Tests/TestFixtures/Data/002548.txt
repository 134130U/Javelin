High density planting of a vineyard on the slopes of the Azeit√£o mountains has produced a rich and seriously dense wine. It has enormous amounts of spice, oak-aged flavors and bitter tannins. The red fruits are lost at this stage in the welter of other flavors. but with time its true, impressive colors with shine. Drink after 2016.
