From one of the most celebrated vineyards in Barbaresco, this structured wine offers aromas of mature black fruit accented with whiffs of balsamic herbs and new leather. The palate delivers crushed black cherry and rasberry layered with notes of black pepper, licorice and menthol alongside assertive tannins. It needs time to unfold and develop. Drink 2016â€“2026.
