From an interior subregion of Hawke's Bay, this shows classic oak-aged Pinot aromas of cherries, brown sugar and baking spices. It's medium in weight, with a suede-like texture and a savory, mocha-tinged finish. This is already showing a hint of bricking at the rim, so drink it over the next few years.
