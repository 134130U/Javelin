This biodynamically farmed wine comes from Steep Creek Ranch next to the winery facility and Nelson Vineyard on the shores of the Columbia River. It shows lots of intrigue, with pure notes of herbs, mulberry and mineral that are enjoyable yet elusive. It's clingy in feel, with elegant yet rich fruit flavors.
