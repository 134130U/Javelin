This elegant Pinot Bianco boasts typical varietal sensations of spring flowers, Alpine herbs and green apples. The savory but reserved palate offers juicy apples, citrus, a hint of mineral and lively acidity. Pair it with appetizers, light fish dishes or as sip as an ap√©ritif. Omniwines, Astor Wines.
