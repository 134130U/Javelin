Totally creamy notions of rose and carnation create a seductive nose. The palate joins in with ample fruit and sweetness. The residual sugar is finely balanced with lemony freshness: a very traditional, if not to say old-fashioned Gew√ºrztraminer, but totally charming and rather delicious. Finishes medium sweet.
