Aromas of tilled soil, blue flower, new saddle leather, underbrush and woodland berry waft from the glass after pouring this savory wine. The spicy palate offers creamy black cherry and raspberry layered with white pepper, clove and cinnamon. The juicy palate is supported by firm, polished tannins and fresh acidity.  Drink after 2016.
