This opens with aromas of ripe berry, aromatic herb, pressed rose petal and a balsamic note. The rather lean palate offers sour cherry, crushed strawberry, sage and star anise alongside nervous acidity and tightly wound, astringent tannins that leave a rather raspy finish. Give this a few more years to unclench. Drink after 2019.
