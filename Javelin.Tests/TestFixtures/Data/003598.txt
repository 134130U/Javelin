This coastal-influenced Chardonnay smells of green olive, iodine and sea brine more than fruit. A citric, high-intensity palate is chalky and minerally, as intended. Flavors of dried, briny stone fruits and apple are outright salty like the ocean, while the finish on this new wine from chalk-based soils is woody and briny, with juicy acidity.
