Leafy underbrush, new leather, dark berry and chopped herb aromas waft out of the glass. The fresh, chewy palate doles out succulent wild cherry, ripe raspberry, white pepper and cinnamon notes, blanketed in smooth, round tannins. A licorice note caps off the finish. It's already delicious but will also offer fine drinking over the next several years. Drink 2018â€“2024.
