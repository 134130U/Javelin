This gripping, delicious wine seamlessly weaves together sensations of blue flower, exotic incense, ripe black cherry, mature plum, cracked pepper, mocha, clove and graphite. It's already delicious and well balanced, with bracing tannins and racy acidity, but give it time to soften and develop complexity. Drink 2019â€“2029.
