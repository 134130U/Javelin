Clarissa Nagy, whose main job is making wine for Riverbench, sources grapes from the nearby Garey Ranch Vineyard for this bottling. It shows strawberry, plum blossom, beet juice, rose petals and cola on the nose. The palate is light and easy, with flavors of pencil lead, Earl Grey tea and brisk cranberry juice.
