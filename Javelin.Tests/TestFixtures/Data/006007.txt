Separate from the other Original Vines bottling, this is part of the new single-vineyard series, and includes the famed South Block grapes. Lush and fragrant, full-bodied yet in the classic, elegant Eyrie tradition, this bursts with complexity. Bramble, cherries, strawberry preserves, coffee grounds and a hint of root beer come together in a deep, dense and thoroughly delicious wine.
