Paul Hobbs coaxes beautifully classic Cab aromas and textures from this wine, which comes from the tricky 2011 vintage. Expect black currant, olive, cassis and peppercorn to intermingle on the palate amidst soft elegance, the perfect balance between fruity and herbal. On the finish a dusting of mocha turns up the dial on deliciousness.
