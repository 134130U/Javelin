This hillside-grown wine is only vineyard-designated in special vintages. The nose is like a delicate pine sap, with elements of spearmint, sweet camphor and anise set against light raspberry juice. It's elegant but energetic, with soy sauce, clove and menthol highlighting the hibiscus and red and purple fruits.
