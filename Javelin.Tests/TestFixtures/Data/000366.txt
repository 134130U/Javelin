Red berry, rose and clove are some of the aromas you'll find on this bright, supple red. The smooth palate offers juicy black cherry, crushed strawberry and white pepper alongside fresh acidity. A mineral vein underscores the savory flavors and energizes the finish. It's made to be drunk young so enjoy soon. Drink through 2018.
