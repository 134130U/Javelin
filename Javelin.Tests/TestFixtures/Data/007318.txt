This is an intensely rich wine, opulent although with a sense of texture and a drier core. It's a full bodied, generous wine, fruity and structured. As a contrast, a surprising streak of fresh acidity brings an apple character to the more tropical fruit flavors. The wine should age, so drink from 2017.
