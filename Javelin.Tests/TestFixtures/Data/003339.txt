An opaque color is a fair warning of what's to come: namely rubbery minerally black-fruit aromas that scream old vines. In the mouth, this blocky Carignan is flush and shows wall-to-wall saturation. Wild aromas of mountain herbs, blueberry and boysenberry finish sinewy and with spicy minerally black-fruit leftovers. Drink through 2023.
