This bottling comes off a select corner of the Talley family ranch and is quite shy on the nose at first, reluctantly offering beet, cranberry, and cooked strawberry aromas, with the slightest touch of caramelization and loam. The flavors tend toward bramble, with wild thyme, white pepper and oregano, starting off simple but growing persistent and beautiful as the wine opens.
