This is a more serious style of ros√©. It is structured with an edge of tannins that lead to richness as well as piles of delicious red-berry fruits and considerable balanced acidity. Owned by the Fabre family, this vineyard dates back to 1910. The estate produces the wine, although it is bottled by the Saint-Tropez cooperative. Drink now.
