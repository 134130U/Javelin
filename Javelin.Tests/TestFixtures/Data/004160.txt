Made entirely with Nerello Cappuccio, this reveals aromas of raspberry compote, tilled earth, ripe berry and grilled herb. The juicy palate delivers fleshy black cherry, licorice, white pepper and a hint of sage alongside bright acidity and smooth tannins. It's already accessible. Drink through 2019.
