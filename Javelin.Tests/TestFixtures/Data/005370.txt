Named for a small volcanic outcrop on the Niven family's sprawling property, this bottling from winemaker Christian Roguenant shows hearty black cherry, vanilla and star anise spice on the nose. The palate is extremely floral, with lavender, violet and elderflower scents, along with plum skin and crushed-slate flavors.
