Made from the native grape Pugnitello, this hearty red opens with aromas of dried Mediterranean herbs, scorched earth, allspice and overripe black fruit. The warm, forward palate doles out baked plum, ripe blackberries, blue flowers, clove and the heat of evident alcohol. Velvety tannins wrap around the palate, but the dominant alcohol throws it off balance and gives it a monolithic character.
