The Mark VI (similar to the above Heather's Vineyard) is a sort of reserve reserve, this one from barrels chosen to showcase the most cellar-worthy aspects of the vintage. It succeeds nicely, delivering a solid, firm, tart wine with young raspberry and cherry fruit at its center. The tannins have a lightly herbal, leafy streak, and there's little doubt this will benefit from additional years in the cellar.
