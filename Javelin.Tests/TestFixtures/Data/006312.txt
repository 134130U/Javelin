Vargellas is always associated with violet aromas as well as the strength and power of its wines inside a velvet glove. The 2012 is concentrated yet soft and smooth on the surface. It's fruity and fresh, while brooding with inner strength. Drink now for its fruit; wait until 2021 for its power and longevity.
