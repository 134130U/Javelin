A 50-50 blend of Ciliegiolo and Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of blackberry extract, espresso, tilled soil and a balsamic note. The palate offers dried black cherries accented with mint, menthol and licorice alongside drying, woody tannins. Drink before 2018 to capture what remains of the fruit.
