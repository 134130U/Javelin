A blend of 60% Syrah, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Merlot, this inky garnet-colored wine offers aromas of cassis and elderberry. On the palate, there is a combination of cooked fruit and cool spice flavors yet there is no lack of accompanying acidity. Flavors of cassis, elderberry, anise, orange peel and vanilla are backed by silky tannins that stay smooth into the cooling finish.
