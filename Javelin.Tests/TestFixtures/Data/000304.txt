Winemaker Bill Brosseau hits a single vineyard home run with this bottling from one of the Central Coast's oldest sites. It shows exotic plum, tangy cranberry, pine needle, juniper and pencil shaving scents on the nose. The palate is steeped in mulberry, marjoram and curry-like Indian spices, proving dynamic and delicious in the most compelling ways.
