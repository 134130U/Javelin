It's a shame quantities of this wine are so minuscule (20 cases imported), because it shows the enormous potential of the appellation and producer. Intense aromas of smoke, espresso and black olive lead to a palate that's full bodied and creamy in texture. There's some oak influence, but the notes of vanilla, cinnamon and clove are just an accent to the harmonious whole. Drink nowâ€“2020.
