Hanzell took on a new barrel regime with the 2011 vintage, opening the door to several different coopers to taste over time. Additionally in 2011, the Pinot grapes came from both the Sessions and de Brye vineyards. The wine is marked by a bouquet of baked strawberry and cherry, the layers interwoven in oak and dust.
