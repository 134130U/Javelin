A lavish deep blend of 66% Mourvèdre and 34% Tannat, this is not for the faint of heart or weak in spirit. Pitch black in the glass, it shows espresso, vanilla, caramel and leather touches on the nose. Black cherry and crème de cassis flavors pop on the palate, with strong coffee-like tannins and a creamy vanilla finish. It's still quite young.
