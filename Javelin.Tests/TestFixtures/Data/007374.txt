The Hope Family Wines' blend of 50% Marsanne and 50% Viognier offers aromas of ripe melon, smoked lemon rinds, apple custard and roasted chicken on the nose. Creamy flavors of ripe apple and pear are cut with a clean space of lemony acidity in this rich white wine that could handle a variety of food.
