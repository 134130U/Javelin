Almost 2% higher in alcohol than the 2011, this young and ageworthy effort spent time in 50% new French oak. It retains a moderate herbal edge, a hint of hemp, and sleek cranberry and cherry fruit. The acidity is stiff and the overall sense is that the wine will continue to improve through 2020 or more.
