Attractive fruity tones of red currant, raspberry and strawberry hull dance in the bouquet of this pretty ros√©, graced by garrigue accents of lavender and rosemary. Flavors of red berry skin and peach pit unfold on the medium-weight palate, framed by soft tannins and a delicate spice note that lingers on the close.
