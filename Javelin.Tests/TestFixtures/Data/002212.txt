Aromas of mocha, espresso, coconut, ripe black-skinned fruit and new wood lead the nose on this hearty blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Cabernet Franc, 25% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot. The thickly concentrated palate offers up dried black cherry, roasted coffee beans, toasted oak and vanilla alongside astringent tannins.
