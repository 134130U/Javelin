A 100% Roussanne wine is rare in its normal origin, the Rh√¥ne Valley. Here, in the mountains, it has produced this intensely perfumed, tightly textured wine that is both unusual and delicious. Crisply textured and with spice and a dry edge, the wine could be aged for a few months. Drink from the end of 2016.
