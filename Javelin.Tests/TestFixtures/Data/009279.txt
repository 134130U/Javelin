This is a dark saturated fully oaked Rioja with savory briary berry aromas and notes of coffee grounds, fennel and hard spices. A full chunky palate is displaying young rubbery tannins. Flavors of baked plum, grilled meat, raw oak and lemon peel finish with toasty oak that veers towards maple. Drink through 2030.
