This is one of famed Pinot Noir winemaker Lane Tanner's first stabs at this grape, and she succeeds strongly in this brand with business partner Will Henry. Aromas of cherry, bark, mint candy, dried rose petal and sagebrush give way to an inviting berry pie flavor, followed by a slowly emergent herbal grip that's reminiscent of pine sap.
