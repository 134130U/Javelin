Austria-trained, Santa Barbara County-based winemaker Graham Tatomer is causing a Riesling renaissance, thanks to wines like this with aromas of orange blossom, citrus rinds and hints of gasoline. With flavors of toasted nuts, lemon juice, tangerine pith and chalky grip, this is a great canvas for cellar aging to paint a remarkable wine. Drink 2018â€“2030.
