This is one of Oregon's most unique wines, and one that rises confidently to the level of excellent cru Beaujolais in a ripe year. Bright and spicy with generous flavors of strawberry and blueberry, this sports lip-smacking acidity and a dash of minerality. The sweet young fruit is full, forward and delicious.
