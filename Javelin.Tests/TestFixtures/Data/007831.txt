Juicy blackberry, blueberry, black cherry, violet, mineral and black pepper are just some of the aromas and flavors of this savory, vibrant red. Made with organically farmed grapes and fermented with native yeasts, it's earthy, zesty, firmly structured and yet so drinkable. Kermit Lynch Wine Merchants, Estelle Imports.
