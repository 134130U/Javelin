The winery produces two outstanding Pinots from estate vineyards planted in 1972. This is big and chewy (as the potent alcohol might suggest) and aging in 50% new French oak puts flavors of toasted coconut and caramel around smooth supple cherry fruit. There's a finishing hint of eucalyptus; all in all, it's a terrific value and a truly original take on Pinot Noir.
