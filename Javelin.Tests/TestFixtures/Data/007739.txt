This medium-bodied, understated wine has a rather light red color with brown undertones. It offers subtle earthy and smoky aromas, tart fruit flavors like cranberries, and an appropriately tannic texture. While its flavors are subtle, the balance is great and this wine stayed fresh for three days after opening.
