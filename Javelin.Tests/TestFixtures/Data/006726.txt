The fruit for this 100% varietal wine is sourced from Calistoga and Rutherfordâ€”a blend that yields a densely tannic, meaty palate that combines soy, cedar and pepper notes. Having already matured in bottle for some time, it's still slowly unfurling, offering jammy blackberry and licorice flavors that add spice to the finish.
