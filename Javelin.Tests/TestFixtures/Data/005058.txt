There's been an evolution taking place at this house, with new oak no longer ubiquitous in the offerings. In fact, this wine is aged solely in concrete, which allows charming hints of lavender and thyme to shine among the cherry and cocoa notes. It's full-bodied yet firm, so pair it with burgers or steaks off the grill.
