As with tawny Ports, the other Douro fortified wine, Moscatel, is aged in wood for an average of a decade. In this 10-year old, the wine still has its fruit, but it is just starting to show old wood aging flavors that are beginning to concentrate it. There is a strongly perfumed, spicy aftertaste. Drink now.
