There's nothing shy about this Zin, which showcases both the variety's personality and the wine's terroir. The raspberry, licorice and espresso flavors have a sweet edge of brown sugar. The finish is entirely dry but hot, but that's part of Dry Creek's charm, and suggests pairing with rich, spicy, smoky meats.
