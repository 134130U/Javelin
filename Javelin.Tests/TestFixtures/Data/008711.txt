There's something rustic about this Cab. Partly it's the tannins, which are fierce. Partly it's the alcohol, which sticks out and gives the wine a burn. Yet it's extraordinarily ripe and opulent in black currants, with the liqueur headiness of cr√®me de cassis. The hot alcohol suggests it will not age.
