Herbal and earthy up front, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Carmen√®re and Malbec brings notes of green tobacco and black olive to the front along with toasty oak. The palate is tight and crisp, with choppy tannins. Flavors of toasty oak and berry fruit compote finish resiny, with juicy, zesty acidity. Drink through 2021.
