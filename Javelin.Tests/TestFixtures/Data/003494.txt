A southern Rhone-style blend of Roussanne, Marsanne and Viognier, only 20% was aged in oak. Bright, aromatic, and fleshy on the palate, and showing an array of cucumber, green leaf, lemon oil, pineapple and citrus notes, this impressive white blend hits just the right notes for lighter dishes with an herbal dressing.
