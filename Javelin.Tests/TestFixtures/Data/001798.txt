This block selection hews closer to more conventional Oregon Pinots than the rest of the winery's portfolio, with powerful focused black-cherry fruit at its heart. It was fermented with native yeast and spent 17 months in barrel, 12% new. Those flavors come through in deft touches of graham cracker and cocoa powder, underscored with a wet-cement minerality.
