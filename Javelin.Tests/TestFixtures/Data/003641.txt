Intense aromatics of plum, cherry and red currant introduce this wine. There's a whiff of pencil lead, and the bold fruit flavors capture a bit of brush and bramble along with perfect, clean ripeness. A suggestion of candle wax comes up. This is a powerful wine that continually demands your attention.
