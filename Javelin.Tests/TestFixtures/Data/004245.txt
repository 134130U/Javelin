This graceful, light-bodied wine from a promising new brand smells of strawberries and cream and tastes fresh and well-balanced. Red cherry, strawberry and clove notes blend with the creamy texture, leaving a soft but lightly tannic feel on the tongue that makes the wine even more appetizing and complete.
