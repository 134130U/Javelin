This late release is an unusual blend of Syrah, Baco Noir, Tempranillo and Dolcetto. All are strengths of the AVA, though rarely blended together. The extra bottle age has smoothed the rough edges, yielding a pleasant-drinking wine with flavors of strawberry preserves, citrus peel, and a touch of malt powder.
