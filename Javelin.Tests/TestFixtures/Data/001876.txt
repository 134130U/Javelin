A Castillon ridge mix of 95% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc, this perfumed wine has new wood and mint flavors that balance with the black fruits and tannins. It's ripe, with fresh acidity as well as structure. There's just 8,500 bottles from 7.5 acres. This will age well, so drink from 2017. Owner Nicolas Thienpont purchased the vineyard in 2011.
