Enticing floral, wild berry, new leather and truffle aromas seemingly float out of the glass, growing darker with spice as the wine takes on air. The palate is elegant and still youthfully austere, offering Marasca cherry, crushed raspberry, clove and white pepper flavors, framed by firm, chewy tannins and vibrant acidity. A licorice note closes the lingering finish. Drink 2020â€“2035.
