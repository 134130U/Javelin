An amber-peach color and slight cloudiness signal that this dry wine is atypical. Its aromas are buttery and earthy, its flavors are savory and substantial (think melon and prosciutto), and the texture is unusually creamy, giving it a long, lingering finish. With great, supportive acidity and a touch of tannic grip, it's not a simple ap√©ritif, calling instead for bold tapas or charcuterie.
