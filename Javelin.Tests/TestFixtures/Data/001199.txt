From the vineyard planted by the Pisoni and Franscioni families, this wine delivers bright raspberry and strawberry aromas with sweet star anise spice. The medium-bodied palate is lively and boisterous, with ripe cranberry, tangy red plum skin and sour cherry flavors, accented with a helping of dried herbs.
