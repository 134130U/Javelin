From a recently planted site on the Oregon side of the Columbia Gorge, this combines tangy, raspberry fruit concentration with elegance. Spicy and vertically stacked with flavors, it moves from brambly, peppery fruits into a long finish with highlights of cinnamon and spice. The vine cuttings are from Lonnie Wright's original (1893) planting.
