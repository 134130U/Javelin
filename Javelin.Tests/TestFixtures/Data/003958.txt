With only 12% new oak and 28% of the fruit coming from the cool Eden Valley, this wine may hold more appeal to lovers of Old World Syrah than any other Torbreck bottling. Pepper, bacon fat and mixed berries mark the nose, while the palate is full, creamy and expansive. The long finish includes enough soft, dusty tannins to suggest cellaring through 2030 as a possibility, although it's delicious now.
