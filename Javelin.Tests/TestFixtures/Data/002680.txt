Fermented with roughly one-third whole clusters, this wine brings a juicy mix of blackberry and black-cherry fruit front and center, with the AVA's wet-stone minerality underneath. This young wine seems built for the wine cellar. If you plan to drink it sooner, give it an hour in the decanter. Drink 2020â€“2030.
