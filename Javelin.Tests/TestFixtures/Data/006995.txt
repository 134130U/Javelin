This is a giant of a wine, packed to bursting with dark chocolate, black cherry, black pepper and clove flavors, all wrapped in a soft layer of tannins. Made of 63% Petite Sirah, 31% Cabernet Sauvignon and dashes of three other grapes, it has good depth, concentration and full body, and will make maximum impact at your next party.
