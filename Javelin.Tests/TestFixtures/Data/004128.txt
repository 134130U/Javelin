Good for Burgess for holding this Syrah back for a little while. It's beginning to soften, just barely. The tannins are still strong, but you can taste those bright blackberries and cherries starting to show meaty hints of wild grilled portobello mushrooms. It will drink well in late 2014 with hearty roasts and stews.
