Made entirely from Pinot Nero, this fragrant Metodo Classico offers tantalizing red berry, citrus, rose and cake spice scents. It's bright and elegantly sparkling, delivering juicy strawberry, tart cherry, tangerine and pastry cream flavors, framed by crisp acidity. A hint of cinnamon closes the quenching finish, calling for a second bottle.
