The top wine from this estate is impressive. It has rich black fruits and firm tannins, showing its youthfulness. Its weight and concentration combine with the ripe fruits to give a wine that is destined for long-term aging. NÃ©grette, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon go into this fine blend. Drink it from 2020.
