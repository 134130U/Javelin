This is a new, value label under the Barons umbrella, produced by consulting winemaker Matthew Loso. Lovely raspberry fruit anchors the flavors, which are sleek and stylish and, show the craftsmanship of much more expensive vino. Dark notes of mineral and a whiff of graphite and iodine add complexity through a surprisingly long finish.
