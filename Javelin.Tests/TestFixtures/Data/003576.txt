This hefty but sluggish Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend opens with forceful aromas of earthy, herbal red-berry fruits and sweet oak. Chunky, thick and almost syrupy in feel, this tastes of herbal plum and spiced berry fruits. The longer it rests, the fatter and chunkier it gets. This warm-vintage has weight issues.
