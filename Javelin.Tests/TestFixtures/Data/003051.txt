From an estate vineyard planted high atop the Sebastopol Hills near Freestone, this wine impresses from start to finish. It shows unique white pepper and floral aromas, while a seamless texture supports its succulent cranberry and cherry flavors, a long, lingering accent of nutmeg spice rounding out the finish.
