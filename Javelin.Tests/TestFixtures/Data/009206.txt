It's another inky Rh√¥ne monster with aging potential from Epoch and their historic Paderewski Vineyard. This Syrah-led blend throws off inviting aromas of black cherry pie, violet, fennel and balsamic vinegar reduction. Once sipped, layers of flavor emerge steadily, with blackberry fruit roll-up, wet pipe tobacco, candied nuts, lingering herbs and a slight vanilla finish. Serve with osso buco or otherwise roasted pork.
