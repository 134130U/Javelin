Enticing floral, woodland berry, new leather and tilled soil aromas come together in this stunning red. Vibrant and elegant, the linear palate delivers wild cherry, red raspberry, cinnamon and clove notes, framed by firm, refined tannins and vibrant acidity. The youthful tension is pleasant, but give it time to develop even more complexity. Drink 2020â€“2033.
