New Jersey home-winemaker-turned-California-Pinot-pro David Rossi delivers a delicious wine from the eastside of the Salinas Valley, with umami-meets-floral aromas of wild strawberry-clove mousse, violet-infused soy sauce and eucalyptus shavings. Ripe flavors of raspberry and blackberry get lifted by nutmeg, allspice and pine, with a tart, bitter cranberry-skin note on the finish.
