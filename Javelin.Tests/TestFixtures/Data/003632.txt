Generosity, expressed by the scent of sun-ripened Bosc pear peel, becomes immediately apparent. The ripe and luscious pear aromatics pervade the palate with their fruity, almost floral charm. There is some residual sweetness, boosting these flavors even more, but balance is struck by shining freshness and a pear-peel texture to finish with beguiling freshness. This is textbook stuff and utterly moreish.
