Woody notes of cedar and cigar box blend harmoniously with bright red currant and blackberry on the nose. Cigar box tones continue on to the palate, alongside flavors of black cherry, blackberry and Chinese five spice. The grippy tannins are well matched with crisp acidity and lush body, while the finish is long, dry and spicy.
