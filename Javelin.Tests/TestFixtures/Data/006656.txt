Round, earthy blackberry aromas are dressed up in dry spice and oak. A fleshy, pure palate has bounce to its step, while oaky, toasty flavors of baked black fruits, cocoa and spice finish with just the right amount of cutting acidity and flavors of baking spices. Drink this Cabernet Franc-led blend through 2020.
