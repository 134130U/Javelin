This is a transition vintage, in which Alex Sokol Blosser has taken over the principal winemaker duties. This is a delicate, well-structured effort, showing an aromatic mix of cherry blossoms, clove and orange peel notes. Refined raspberry and cherry fruit carries a streak of tarragon, and finishes just slightly bitter.
