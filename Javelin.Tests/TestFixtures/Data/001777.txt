Consistently one of New Zealand's top Chardonnay producers, Neudorf flies the standard for Nelson, almost next door to better-known Marlborough. The medium-bodied 2014 Chardonnay begins with appetizing scents of toast, oak spice and white peach. On the palate, there's a lovely combination of spice and stone fruit, then lingering citrus on the finish. Drink nowâ€“2020.
