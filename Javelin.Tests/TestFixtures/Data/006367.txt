Under the same ownership as Ch√¢teau la Dominque in neighboring Saint-Emilion, this estate produces 100% Merlot. This generous wine with its rich tannins is dark with tight acidity, juicy black fruits and dark coffee flavors. It is concentrated and is going to take many years to soften. Drink from 2023.
