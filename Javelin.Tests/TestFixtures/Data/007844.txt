Peach, honeyed limes and apple sauce aromas lead the nose of this blend made with 62% Viognier, 26% Grenache Blanc and 12% Rousanne. Caliza's Carl Bowker demonstrates great restraint in these often bombastic white Rh√¥nes, so the apple-led palate is subdued, showing bits of spice or a touch of mustard on the end.
