This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese has a rather inexpressive nose that eventually reveals bell pepper, cedar and spice. The palate offers dried black cherries, oak, sawdust and oak-driven spice while astringent wood tannins give it an abrupt, drying finish. It lacks vibrancy and there's not enough fruit richness to stand up to the oak.
