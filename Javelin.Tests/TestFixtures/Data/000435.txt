The nose on this wine from American Idol producers Nigel Lythgoe and Ken Warwick is a bit reluctant to show itself at first, then lets go of rounded red and purple fruits, with freshly turned soil and dust. Ripe black cherries and tart plum skins mix on the earthy palate, and the tannins will unfurl with more time.
