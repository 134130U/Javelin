Already very approachable, this is a rich wine that still manages to preserve its freshness, with acidity from the blackberry and damson-fruit flavors. With Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend, the tannins are strongly present, however the delicious fruit tones are decidedly in charge. Drink now.
