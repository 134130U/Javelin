White flowers, spun honey and graham cracker aromas introduce this wine that will be a hit with those who prefer a sweet touch to their bottles. The palate is very sweet, even treacly, with honeysuckle nectar, sugared apples and candied orange flavors. There's just enough acidity to somewhat balance the sugars.
