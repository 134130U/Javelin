Half Wadenswil and half Pommard, from a 1989 planting, this single-vineyard selection is taut and juicy, a mix of citrus and raspberry, remaining sharply focused even after 48 hours of breathing time. The bright fruit, proportion and precision are impressive, though it needs a bit more bottle age to open up completely.
