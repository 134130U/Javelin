This opens with aromas of scorched earth, cooked black-skinned fruit and a funky whiff of barnyard. The aromas carry over to the palate along with notes of prune, overripe black fruit and green sensations that recall powdered sage. It's on the rustic side, while raspy tannins lend it an astringent finish.
