Undergrowth, truffle, black-skinned berry and exotic spice aromas meld with balsamic notes. Rounded and chewy, the palate doles out fleshy black cherry, blackberry extract, cinnamon, licorice and chopped mint flavors, enveloped in velvety tannins. A hint of carob closes the finish. Drink through 2024.
