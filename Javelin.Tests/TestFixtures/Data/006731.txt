Earthy plum and leather aromas fold in notes of prune, rubber and oak. This shows a firm grip, tomato-like acidity and a layer or two of complexity. Peppery, toasty plum, oak and spice flavors are integrated into a quality whole, while this Carignan-Garnacha blend finishes long, dry, peppery and elegant. Drink through 2020.
