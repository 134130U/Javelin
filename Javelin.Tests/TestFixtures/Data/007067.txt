This Bordeaux-style blend is 28% Merlot, 28% Cabernet Franc, 41% Cabernet Sauvignon and 3% Petit Verdot. Sweet scents of cracker open into a wine with pretty red plum and details of coffee and chocolate. It does not in any way reflect the rather high-listed alcohol, but seems more elegant and lightly refined.
