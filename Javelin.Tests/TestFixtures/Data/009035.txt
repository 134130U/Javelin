Foursight has taken a new stylistic direction with Pinot Noir that involves wild yeast fermentation and no fining or filtration. This medium-bodied, garnet-colored wine is appealing for its firm mouthfeel and lean fruit flavors that are neither overripe nor over-extracted. Its tart cherry and rhubarb aromas and great acidity have a palate-cleansing effect.
