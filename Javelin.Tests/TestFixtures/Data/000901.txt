The floral perfume of this cool-climate bottling is intenseâ€”all lavender accented with black pepper, white pepper and thyme. Tart black plum skin flavors lead the palate, building towards savory elements that recall dried purple flowers, thyme, rosemary and black pepper. Medium bodied and dense, it will be versatile with food.
