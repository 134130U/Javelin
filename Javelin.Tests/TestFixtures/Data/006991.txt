With vines in the village of Lamarque close to the Gironde estuary, this estate is well placed to benefit from the warmth of the water. The wine, a blend of 55% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot (with the remainder Petit Verdot) is richly structured and dense. It has firm tannins as well as perfumed black-currant fruit. The wine will be ready to drink from 2021.
