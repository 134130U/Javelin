This wine takes white Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape to rare heights. Mouthwatering aromas of toasted nuts and pineapple set the stage for a full-bodied, rich, succulent wine experience whose finish lingers. Yet despite the wine's undeniable heft, it never seems overly weighty. Drink this blend of 80% Roussanne and 20% Grenache Blanc over the next couple of years.
