Merlot makes up just over half of this wine, with Cabernet Sauvignon (39%) playing second fiddle and Cabernet Franc and Malbec rounding it out. It's expressive, with aromas of fig, golden raisins, eucalyptus and red fruit, with the aromas seeming slightly dried out. The palate is fruit forward and textured, while still showing restraint and length.
