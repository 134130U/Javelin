Bryan Babcock heads to Bentrock Vineyard on the southwestern edge of the appellation to deliver this wine redolent of red cherry, plum, mulberry, peppery spice and sagebrush. The palate is rich and full bodied, with tangy red plum skin and eucalyptus touches, finishing on a fresh, menthol-like note.
