Once past an element of burnt rubber that mingles with the ripe blackberry aromas, this becomes a hearty and concentrated wine yet one with very moderate alcohol. It has plenty of tannins to add texture, and enough concentration to keep the vivid berry and wood smoke flavors lingering on the finish. It's made without adding sulfites.
