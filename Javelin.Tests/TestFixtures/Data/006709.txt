This estate, managed for the owner by Producteurs Plaimont, surrounds a perfectly preserved medieval castle. The wine is firm with tense tannins and intense juicy acidity. It has a structured character full of blackberry fruit and with a dry core. It hints at being mature already although it will be much better to drink from 2018.
