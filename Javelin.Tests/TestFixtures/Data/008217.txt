Lifted notes of rose water and honeysuckle blossom rise immediately from the glass. They remain just as perfumed on the palate, clothing peach fruit in floral fragrance. There is a pleasantly bitter edge and just enough freshness to stand up to the opulent flavors. This finishes medium sweet and has a perfumed finish.
