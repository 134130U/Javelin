Christian Beyer is the 14th generation to run his family's estate. This wine is one of his jewels, a ripely luscious wine that's so well balanced. While honey creeps into the flavors, it's also full of fruits, with a ripe and unctuous texture. The spice gives a dry edge to the otherwise medium-sweet wine that's structured and firm at the end. Drink from 2017.
