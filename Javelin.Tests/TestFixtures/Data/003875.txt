A light mauve in color, this Pinot Noir-based wine shows boisterous plum fruit, macerated strawberries and a hint of clove on the ripe nose, making it more entrée-ready than apéritif-aimed. The palate offers strawberry and bubble-gum notes deftly hidden behind a veil of sour cherry and plum-skin tartness.
