Baked red cherry, vanilla pastry, loam, dried mint and forest floor notes all show in this excellent bottling from Bryan Babcock's family vineyard. Its tannic structure is immediately apparent, framing a core of raspberry fruit rounded out with thyme, oregano, black pepper and sea salt flavors. Drink 2021â€“2029.
