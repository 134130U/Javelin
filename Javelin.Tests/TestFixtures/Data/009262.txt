This 100% estate-grown field blend of Zinfandel and Petite Sirah made in microscopic quantities impresses in every way. Smoky dust hits the nose first, before ushering in soft layers of juicy, lush blackberry, savory pepper and herb. Balanced and delicious, it's a worthwhile find from Rutherford, land of Cab.
