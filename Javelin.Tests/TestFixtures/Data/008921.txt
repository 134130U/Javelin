This powerful blend of 23% Malbec, 20% Carmenere, 20% Cabernet Franc, 16% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Merlot and 7% Petite Verdot delivers layered aromas of olallieberry, grape candy, sage, anise and lava rocks. Purple fruits dominate the palate, with complexity provided by creosote and violets, along with ample tannins and acidity.
