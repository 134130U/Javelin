This blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Syrah and 10% Sangiovese opens with aromas of toasted oak, espresso, black fruit and whiffs of green pepper. The densely concentrated, low-acid palate is one-dimensional, delivering fleshy black cherry and bell pepper accented with roasted coffee bean and sweet vanilla. Drink soon.
