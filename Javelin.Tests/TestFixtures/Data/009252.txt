Aromas suggest blueberry, coffee and orange rind. The nice marriage of cooked and fresh fruit flavors with cool herbal notes includes blueberry, black cherry, anise, eucalyptus, coffee, pencil lead and violet. Tannins come on strong but back off appropriately, and the pleasing finish includes lasting touches of leather and tart cherry.
