Reuling is humming its way toward continued greatness in working with its own coveted fruit, crafting a coming-together of earthy fruit and lush texture. This vintage is dark ruby in color, classic in complex forest floor and wild strawberry layered over flowery perfume and a streak of spice. The imprint of oak and girth is still evolving, and the structure is there to cellar from 2017â€“2021.
