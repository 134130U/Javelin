A complete wine in every way, this limited (three barrel) reserve opens with solid bass notes of thick wood and dark fruit. That platform of black cherry and cassis is adorned with light touches of pepper, vanilla, mocha and the streak of iron that seems to characterize many McMinnville wines. Drink 2015 through 2030.
