This family estate, established since the 14th century, has produced a light, beautifully fruity wine in the difficult 2013 vintage. With red fruits and soft tannins, it is fully of ripe berry flavors cut by acidity.A light structure in the background will allow the wine to age, although it is ready to drink now.
