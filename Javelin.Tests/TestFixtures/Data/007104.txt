The Pannell family, who founded Margaret River's Moss Wood in 1969, moved on in the mid-1990s to Pemberton, where it felt conditions were more suited to Burgundian varieties. This is a rather full-bodied Pinot Noir, with supple tannins and a long, slightly dusty finish. Light resiny notes and rooty scents add complexity to modest cherry fruit. Drink nowâ€“2020.
