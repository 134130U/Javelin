Parts of Clare Valley are ideal for Cabernet Sauvignon, illustrated by this reasonably priced bottling. Mint and cassis show remarkable purity on the nose, while the palate is properly restrained without being hard or austere. That said, there are some dusty tannins on the finish, so drink 2020â€“2030.
