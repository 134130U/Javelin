Fragrant blue flower, red berry, tilled soil and a whiff of new leather take center stage on this bright red. The ripe, straightforward palate delivers crushed Marasca cherry and baking spice alongside round, mature tannins. It's straightforward and already rather evolved so enjoy sooner rather than later.
