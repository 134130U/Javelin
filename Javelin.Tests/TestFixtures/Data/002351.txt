Palliser's top-of-the-line Pinot is named after a different loved companion-dog every year. This is a nearly full-bodied wine, a bit chunky and muscular in style, with cherry and plum fruit and savory overtones beetroot and greens. the finish is long and richly textured, suggesting a reasonable lifespan. Drink 2020â€“2025+.
