This is a terrific discovery from a tiny winery and remote hilltop vineyard near the Pacific Coast. It's deep in color, with aromas evocative of forest floor, rhubarb and rosemary. The palate is woven in structure and enticing fruit and spice flavors. Balance, complexity and moderate tannins combine in an attractive profile and unique personality.
