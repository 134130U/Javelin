Briary berry, tobacco, hickory and spice flavors dominate the nose on this smoky-smelling modern Rioja. This vintage of Amancio, one of Sierra Cantabria's flashiest small-volume wines, is round, meaty and expansive in feel, with oaky flavors of blackberry and bacon. A grabby, spongy, wide finish is savory and oaky in flavor. Give this until 2016, then drink through 2022.
