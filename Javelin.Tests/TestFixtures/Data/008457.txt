Aromas of blue flower, rich black fruit, cooking spices, leather and thyme waft out of the glass of this soulful young Taurasi. The palate offers a juicy core of black cherry accented by notes of black pepper, nutmeg, eucalyptus, pipe tobacco and mineral, with firm acidity and velvety tannins. It's already delicious, but hold for additional complexity. Drink 2019â€“2029.
