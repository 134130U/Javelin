Alluring smature orchard fruit, grilled herb, toasted nut and flint scents take center stage in this savory white, accented by a balsamic note. The round, creamy, palate mirrors the nose, offering juicy white peach, baked apple and celery flavors. A blast of candied tangerine closes the lingering finish.
