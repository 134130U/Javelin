Utter generosity of both ripe and dried pear is immediately evident on the nose. Notions of sandalwood hover. The dry palate carries that same, generous fluidity at its deep core. There is immense concentration, shimmering with dried, fresh and cooked pear. But there also is a sense of earth, stone and fresh orange peel. The wine seems like a message from another world, , leading you beyond the physical, into a wold of contemplation. The finish lasts and lasts.
