Brilliant, crystalline freshness tinged with chervil and lemon is the impression on the nose. The palate is rounder than the nose suggests but has the same brilliance and lightness of flavor. Sylvaner is an underrrated grape that is all about subtlety and herbal nuance. This lovely, expressive but light-bodied example has it in spades. Lemony freshness resonates long.
