This is a lusty, bombastic and burly wine, completely in keeping with the producer's style, mixing smoky bacon, tar, cigar and charcuterie with smooth, round layers of concentration and ripeness. With a handful of Petite Sirah, it aged 14 months in American oak, a charred note that lingers on the finish.
