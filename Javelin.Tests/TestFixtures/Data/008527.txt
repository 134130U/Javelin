Herbal, dusty and oaky on the nose, this wine is sourced from such impressive vineyard sites as Bosche Vineyard and Wood Ranch, and employs small amounts of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. Black currant, dark cherry and clove flavors dominate in this classic, medium-bodied wine with firm tannin and bright acidity.
