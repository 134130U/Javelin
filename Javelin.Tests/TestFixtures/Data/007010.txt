In this exceptional vintage, the all-estate bottling over-delivers big time at this price. Brambly blackberry/kirsch flavors fill the mouth with sappy juicy flavors. The tannins are a bit stiff, and at first the wine hits a tannic wall, but more bottle age, aeration and/or aggressive decanting will open it up. The lengthy cinnamon-soaked finish hints at a stellar cellar life ahead.
