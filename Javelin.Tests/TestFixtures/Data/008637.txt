Made mostly with Cannonau and small amounts of other Sardinian grapes Bovale, Carignano and Malvasia Nera, this structured red conveys aromas of black-skinned fruit, exotic spice, oak and Mediterranean brush. The full-bodied but elegant palate offers dried blackberry, vanilla, roasted coffee bean and savory herb alongside velvety tannins.
