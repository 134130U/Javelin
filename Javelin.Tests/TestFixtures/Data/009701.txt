Inviting aromas of balsam wood, pipe tobacco and black fruits are lusty and deep. This is big and drawing on the palate, with ribald flavors of blackberry, licorice, chocolate and mocha. A rich, chocolaty, oaky finish with controlled acidic kick and tannic bite confirm the wine's power and spirit. Drink through 2020.
