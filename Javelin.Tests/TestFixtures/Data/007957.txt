Roasted beef and bacon fat scents meet with maple, char, Concord grape and blueberry on the nose of this hearty bottling from a winery recently acquired by O'Neill Vintners. Its tannins are deep and firm but welcoming, providing the framework for black currant, blueberry, charred beef and rosemary flavors.
