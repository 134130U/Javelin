This is pure Syrah, sourced from Les Collines in Walla Walla and the Benches in the Horse Heaven Hills. Tart berry and red plum fruit anchors it with sharp acidity. The fruit core has not quite melded with the barrel flavors of caramel and chocolateâ€”give it another couple of years in bottle before popping the cork.
