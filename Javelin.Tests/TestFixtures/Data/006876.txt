All estate grown, this blend is roughly half and half Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with a splash of Sangiovese. Dark and fruity, it opens generously with flavors of black cherry, cassis and a hint of cola, finishing with lick of dark chocolate. A mix of French, Hungarian and American oak—24% new—was used.
