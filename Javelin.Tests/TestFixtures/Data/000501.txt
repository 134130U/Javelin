Dried strawberries, wild berries, cloves cinnamon and cocoa powder power the nose on this bottling from a vineyard named after a famous composer who once owned the property. There's not much fruit on the palate, just a touch of dried black cherries, but plenty of dried herbs, milk and dark chocolate and mocha-cappuccino flavors. It's a touch hot.
