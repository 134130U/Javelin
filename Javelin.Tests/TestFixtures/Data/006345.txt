Crushed violet, red berry, mint and menthol aromas lead the nose. The firm palate offers dried red cherry, raw strawberry, licorice, white pepper and sage alongside grippy tannins that leave an astringent finish. Give the tannins a few more years to unclench then enjoy before the remaining fruit fades.
