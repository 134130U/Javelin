Spanish broom, dried lychee, aromatic Mediterranean herb and balsamic notes are just some of the aromas of this multifaceted wine. The linear palate shows compelling depth, delivering layers of mature yellow apple, Bartlett pear, thyme, salvia and energizing mineral alongside still-bright acidity. This wine could go on for another several years at least. Drink through 2021.
