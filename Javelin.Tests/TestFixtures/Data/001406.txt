Varietally specific aromas of wild flowers, honey and lemon verbena set up an unctuous, creamy palate with modest acidity and lots of weight. Honey, mango, vanilla and other sweet, tropical flavors finish thick but not quite cloying. This is a unique wine for Navarra that deserves to be judged on its own.
