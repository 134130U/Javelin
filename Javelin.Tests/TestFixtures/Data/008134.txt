The Napa-Sonoma winery, straddled across two counties, has added 12% Cabernet Sauvignon to the Cab Franc in this wine. The result is sizable in ripe, blueberry and blackberry fruit, soft tannins and a finish of dark chocolate. Void of any of the variety's signature herbaceous signature, it could easily be mistaken for Cabernet Sauvignon.
