Syrah takes the lead on this blend followed by a healthy dose of Mourv√®dre. It's the latter that is initially evident, with generous white-pepper and meaty aromas followed by fresh flowers, raspberries and a touch of coffee. The red- and blue-fruit flavors show a fine sense of balance, with plenty of hang time on the finish.
