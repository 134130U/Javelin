Bergfeld is named for the winery's historic owner and the land he originally planted around the winery in 1873. Given to old-world airs, the wine is chalky in black fruit, tobacco and mocha, as well as soft, substantial tannins. Generous in juiciness and structure, it has an herbal quality on the finish.
