Quite cloudy due to being unfiltered, it offers subtle lemon peel and chalkboard at first on the nose. Some buttered croissant elements arise as the wine opens up. The mouthfeel is even and soft, with a slight creaminess alongside citrus, peach, and, fittingly, a bit of beeswax. Still very tightly wound, it would go well with a Cobb salad or shrimp Louie.
