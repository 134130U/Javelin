The 91-acre Gr√©zels vineyard surrounds a 12th-century castle. This revived historic vineyard has produced a well-structured wine that is rich, despite its modest alcohol. It is dense with tannins and black fruits that are developing into a smoother texture. The wine needs to age further, so drink from 2017.
