Violets, leather, vanilla, subtle oak and black berry sensations all meld together in the glass. The rich, concentrated palate delivers ripe black cherry and blueberry extract accented by mocha, cinnamon, clove, white pepper and mineral. It's soft and already extremely accessible, with velvety tannins, but will age well for the next five years or so. Drink now through 2019.
