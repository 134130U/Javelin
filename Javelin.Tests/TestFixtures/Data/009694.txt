CÃ´te Bonneville releases this Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend quite late, so it's well into the maturing process. Pretty aromas of smoke, tea and mint accompany secondary fruit flavors. The vintage produced well-balanced wines, but many have slipped into a bit of a dumb phase at the moment, so try in 2015.
