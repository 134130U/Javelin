Warm berry-rhubarb pie notes mix with black pepper and an appealing, shy layer of green bell pepper on this blend of 50% Merlot, 28% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot from three vineyards. Stewed plums, cherries and strawberries dominate the tasty palate, with a proper acidity and woody bitterness as balance.
