The man who makes a million Syrahs dives into a blend of 60% Grenache, 25% Mourv√®dre and 15% Syrah on this bottling, which offers composting lilac, black pepper, fresh boysenberry, dried herb and a tarry quality on the nose. There's a strong blackberry-balsamic reduction flavor once sipped, as well as beef char, elderberry and more tar.
