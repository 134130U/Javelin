Black as night in the glass, this wine shows black cherries, lava rocks and espresso beans on the dense nose. It's thick and chewy once sipped, with zesty acidity that sizzles across the palate, showing blackberry and coffee flavors. It's all power, with very little finesse. Sales of the wine benefit multiple sclerosis research.
