This wine is a blend of Les Collines, Stone Valley, Seven Hills, Pepper Bridge and Summit View fruit. The aromas of plum, stem and herb haven't yet fully revealed themselves. The flavors are lush and layered, with the tannins bringing a touch of astringency on first pour, settling out over time. Best after 2018 or with a short decant.
