Salted peach, hints of dried banana and wisps of smoke show on the rather light and restrained nose of this bottling by Eli Parker and winemaker Blair Fox. The palate plays on acid-driven minerality and the grippy textural side of the grapes, with flavors of yellow apple, ripe nectarine, sea salt and mandarin orange.
