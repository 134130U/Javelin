Made from old vines and aged in small barrels, this wine is dominated by oak. Opening aromas include wood, toast and a hint of butter and apples. Oak extract takes center stage on the palate which also reveals citrus peel and a hint of apricot and mineral, as well as firm acidity. It lacks fruit richness.
