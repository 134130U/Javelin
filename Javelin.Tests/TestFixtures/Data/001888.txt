This is a rich and ripe wine, densely textured with firm tannins that provide a solid structure. Made from selected fruit grown in the north of the Tejo region, the blend of 60% Aragonez, 25% Syrah, 15% Merlot is a textured wood-aged wine that has red and black berry fruits followed by balanced acidity. It is ready to drink, but will improve after 2015.
