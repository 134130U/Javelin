The purest, freshest note of lemon zest and lemon oil creates a dreamy nose. The palate brings in a stony texture that characterizes the entire wine. There is something enduring and stone-like about this, framed with lovely lemon purity. This has barely had time to express itself. There is more to be had from this wine in the future. The long echoes of stone and citrus promise that. Drink 2020â€“2035.
