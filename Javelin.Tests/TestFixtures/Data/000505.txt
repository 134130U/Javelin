Fruit from the Momtazi vineyard often has a strong herbal component, here matched to a tart cranberry base. This wine is young, tight, and slightly bitter in the finish, with a hint of pineapple in the acidity. Overall the winemaker's elegant hand lightens up the aggressive herbaceousness, but a bit more fruit would be welcome.
