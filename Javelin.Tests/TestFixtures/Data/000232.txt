Pure Petit Verdot from Red Mountain's quintessential Bordeaux varietal vineyardâ€”does it get any better? Big, deep and tannic, with lovely purity, this features ultraripe fig and plum fruit with a pleasing salinity. The finish is persistent and shows a streak of iron. Note the alcohol is pushing 16% however it is beautifully integrated.
