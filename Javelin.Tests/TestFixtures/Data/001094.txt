With aromas and flavors reminiscent of apple skin, peach skin, white pepper and pomegranate seed, this tastes crisp, tangy, slightly bitter, and has great bright acidity. It is light to medium bodied and made from 100% whole-cluster-pressed Riesling that was fermented in a combination of older oak barrels and stainless steel vessels.
