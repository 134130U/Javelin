This is a tight and restrained wine from an extreme coastal vineyard behind Cambria. On the nose, it shows touches of raspberry and pomegranate along with non-fruit notes of lavender, dried rose and cinnamon stick. The palate is mineral-driven, with gravel, loam and pencil lead accented by sagebrush, toast and cedar flavors.
