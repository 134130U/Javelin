Keller's Grosses Gew√§chs offerings are hard to come by, even in Germany, but the von der Fels offers GG quality fruit at a markedly gentle price. Orchestral in complexity, it's dry, yet plump with stone fruit and a cashew-nut richness. Taut with acidity, it maintains a dancing, shimmering vitality throughout. It's stunning already, but sure to gain power and density from 2020 on.
