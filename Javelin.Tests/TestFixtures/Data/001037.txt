Dark berry, shoe polish and lemony oak are at the center of the bouquet on this blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Petit Verdot. The palate feels rich to the point of syrupy, while the flavor profile offers a condensed, jammy mix of wild berries, wood, herbs, chocolate and coffee. Additional herbal notes along with spicy flavors carry a thick finish to its conclusion. Drink through 2018.
