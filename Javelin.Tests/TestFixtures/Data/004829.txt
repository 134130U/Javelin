The acidity on this Pinot, along with a mushroom and red tomato earthiness, mark it as Carneros. It's a bit severe and austere, but you will find ripe raspberries, as well as the sweet toastiness of oak. With a dry finish, it's less flashy than some wines , but elegant. And it should develop bottle complexity through 2021.
