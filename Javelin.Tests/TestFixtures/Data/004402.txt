Sourced from a range of vineyards across the Napa Valley, including Atlas Peak, Rutherford and Oakville, this intense wine is informed by thick-grained tannins and pronounced oak. Dark blackberry fruit and clove season it well, along with a finish steep in mocha. The blend includes a small amount of Merlot.
