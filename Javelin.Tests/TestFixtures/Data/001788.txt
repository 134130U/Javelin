Foley's Chardonnays always manage to be both extremely tense yet flavorfulâ€”a combination that will please many palates. This bottling recalls grapefruit, mandarin pith and Asian pear on the nose, its nervy, mineral-driven palate awash with chalk and wet slate notes. It all finishes on a pleasing twist of lime.
