A strong showing from the South Coast, this bottling offers plump red cherries, blackberries, dried plums, cocoa, shaved dark chocolate, kola nut and iron on the nose. The palate is laden with dark chocolate and cinnamon atop elderberry fruit, lifted with elderflower, lilacs and leathery tannins that drive into the finish.
