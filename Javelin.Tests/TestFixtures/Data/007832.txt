The Black Eyed Peas' singer Fergie and renowned winemaker Joey Tensley present an in-your-face Viognier, deeply yellow, nearing brown in color, with aromas of dried apricot, honey-roasted nuts and smoky mezcal with lime. Lush flavors of burnt orange peel, smoke and Scotch whisky make for an intriguing drink, certainly not for those seeking a dainty white wine.
