The grapes are from Mount Veeder, and the wine shows that appellation's strong tannins, as well as its classic black currant and mineral flavors that finish so dry and clean. Made from 100% Cabernet, it was aged in 50% new French oak. The end result is complex, but astringent, not a wine you want to drink now. Give it until 2020 and see what it's doing.
