This has a dark red-black color, with densely packed aromas that seem so tight they are not giving up much. Flavors of concentrated dark plum and white pepper are interlaced with very firm tannins. It's full bodied, young and wound up tight. Drink it now for the wow factor, or be adventurous and save it until 2020 to see how much more flavor complexity develops.
