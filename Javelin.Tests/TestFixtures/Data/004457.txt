Fresh pressed black raspberry and light lavender and lilac show on the tart and peppery nose of this bottling from the Riboli family's broad collection. The structure is chalky and thick on the palate, with flavors of olallieberry paste, blueberry and wet clay, all quite tasty though not extremely complex.
