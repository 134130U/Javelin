This wine has structure and strong old-wood flavors. It comes from the most southerly Premier Cru in the CÃ´te de Beaune, close to the Chalonnaise vineyards. The fruit is still working its way through the tannins of this firm wine. It will have a juicy red-berry character as it develops, giving the potential for aging. Drink from 2018.
