Included in the blend are small portions of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, but this is Merlot with a dark side all its own. Smoke, rubber and tar highlights augment a wine with black fruits, stiff tannins and threads of licorice and sage. It's not your mama's Merlot, but it's authoritative and interesting.
