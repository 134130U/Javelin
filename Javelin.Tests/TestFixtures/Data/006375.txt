With its high proportion of Cabernet Sauvignon, this second wine of Mouton-Rothschild is packed with black currant fruit as well as the intense acidity of the vintage. The fruit is rich, ripe and dark with tannins and black plum flavors. There is spice and toast from the wood aging that will soften as the wine ages. Drink from 2023.
