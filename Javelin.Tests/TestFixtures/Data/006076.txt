From a vineyard surrounded by the region's iconic estates, this study of Pommard and 667 clones used 60% whole cluster and 20% new oak to produce black raspberry, alpine strawberry, chipped slate, dewy bay leaf and vanilla aromas. Bright cranberry and pomegranate juice shows on the palate, which is lifted by a potpourri of eucalyptus and thyme, proving lively and refreshing.
