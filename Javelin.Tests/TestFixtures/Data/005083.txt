Lifted hints of chamomile and apple peel rise straight from the glass. The palate has the same streamlined citrus focus and just homes in on that sleek dry apple freshness that seem to be a dynamic force at the center of this wine. The flavors are concentrated and totally dominated by utter lemon freshness, tart and vivid to the last. Lovely now but with further potential. Drink now through 2030.
