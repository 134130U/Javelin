Juicy blackberry and blackcurrant mix with cocoa, cola and peppercorns on the nose of this densely layered wine. Flavors are deep and dark with tar, pencil shavings, dried blueberry, street asphalt and a strong umami character, still tightly wound at five years old. Let it breathe, or wait another couple years for optimal drinking.
