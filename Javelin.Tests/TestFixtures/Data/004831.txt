This juicy Merlot/Cabernet Franc blend is balanced and fresh with great red fruits and soft tannins. Acidity gives a crisp flavor while the fragrant smokiness allows for future development. This comes from a nine-acre, high-density, hand-picked parcel on a limestone plateau among the Querre family vineyards. Drink from 2017.
