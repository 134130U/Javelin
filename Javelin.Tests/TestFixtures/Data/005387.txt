A very pure but subtle note of Golden Delicious apple hits the nose. The palate rounds out this ripe but tart flavor but also brightens it with lovely apple crispness and freshness. The body is dry and totally fresh with wonderful concentration, aromatic length and purity. This simply leaves you wanting more.
