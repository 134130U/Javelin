Sangiovese is still rather rare in the Walla Walla Valley, but if this is any indication of the potential, it should become a distinctive and valued variety as the vines mature. Lovely aromatics of berry, spice, cedar and toast wrap into a pretty wine with flavors of light cherry, ash and a suggestion of underlying minerality.
