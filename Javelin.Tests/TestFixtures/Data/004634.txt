A solid wine for the price, this often sells for less than suggested retail in grocery stores. This bottling shows bacon fat, tart blackberry, black loam and baked goods on a just-enough-of-everything nose. The soft palate is smooth, with mouth-coating tannins and flavors of cigar leaf, black currant and black pepper.
