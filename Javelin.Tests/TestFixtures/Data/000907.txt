Aged in wood, this wine is rich and spicy. Its fruit though is beautifully in balance, ripe with raspberry and red-currant fruits that are shot through with lemon acidity. This is a full-bodied wine, impressively structured and likely to age for a year or two. It is named after the 946 steps up the mountain behind the estate. Drink from late 2017.
