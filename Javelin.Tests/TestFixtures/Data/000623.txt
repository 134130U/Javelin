Wisps of smoke and candle wax seem savory in contrast to the ripe stone fruit and lemon aromas on this concentrated Riesling. Ripe, juicy tangerine flavors lend sweetness to the palate, but are cut with a vein of lime acidity that reverberates from start to finish. It's delicately textured, yet chock full of vibe and zest.
