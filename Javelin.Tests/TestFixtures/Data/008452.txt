This burly Tempranillo opens with an alluring blend of graphite, stony mineral, marzipan and ripe black-fruit aromas. The palate is lusty, giant and tannic, but not mean or fierce. Blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors end with café mocha and licorice notes, while tannic grab suggests aging this until 2015–16 and drinking through 2023.
