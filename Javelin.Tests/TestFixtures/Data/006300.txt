This blends fruit from 40% Rita's Crown, 30% Bentrock, 16% Clos Pepe, 10% Zotovich and 4% Kessler Haak vineyards to deliver awesome aromas of salted caramel and sea spray. It's soft and lush once sipped with roasted apples and mango, speckled with even acidity and rockiness. It finishes on marshmallow-marzipan flavors, all subtly done.
