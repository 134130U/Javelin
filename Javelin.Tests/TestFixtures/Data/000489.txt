Bloody meats, dried cherries, pressed purple flowers, vanilla and blackberry jam arise on the nose of this blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Cabernet Franc and 7% Merlot, which shows a little age. The purple flowers really come through once sipped, backed up by sour cherries, mocha and sanguine elements, cast across grippy tannins.
