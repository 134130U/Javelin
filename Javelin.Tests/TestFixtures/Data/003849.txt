Structured and fruity, this 25-acre vineyard of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc has produced a blend that is solid and with a good future. It has black fruits and firm tannins along with well-judged wood aging (six to eight months). It is ripe, with attractive juicy flavors and spice. Drink from 2017.
