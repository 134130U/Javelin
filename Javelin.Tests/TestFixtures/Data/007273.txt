Seared yellow apple, lemon rinds and pressed white flowers show on the nose of this bottling from the pioneering winery, which was recently acquired by the Gallo family. The texture is quite steely with bountiful acidity, but the flavors are a little flat on the sip, where stone fruit and squeezed citrus show.
