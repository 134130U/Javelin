This late release, aging for five years, has produced a majestic wine. Its breadth of flavor, with ripe fruits as well as intense structure, are gently transitioning from the first flush of youth to a more mature character. Intensely textured, tight, ready to spring, it shows the beauty of maturing Riesling. Drink now, although it will age many more years.
