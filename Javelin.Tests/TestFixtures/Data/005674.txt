Young Pinot Noir can sometimes dazzle you with juicy expressive downright sensational fruit, as this does. Though tasted prior to its official release, the wine drinks beautifully, offering a big hit of citrus flesh and rind along with lovely raspberry and blueberry fruit. It's forward, fresh, balanced tightly against its lush acidity, and is already just about irresistible.
