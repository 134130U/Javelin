This bright and well-balanced sparkler leads with attractive aromas of fresh lemon and orange slices, lightly toasted brioche and subtle fynbos herbs. The palate is creamy and smooth, with crisp acidity and medium carbonation that lifts and refreshes the finish. Delicious now, or hold through 2017 for a more mature character and additional depth.
