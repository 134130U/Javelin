Only released in top vintages, this is Jim Barry's luxury cuvée of Cabenet Sauvignon. It does see plenty of oak, so it shows impressive notes of baking spices, vanilla and brown sugar, but it backs those with ample dark fruit. It's elegant despite its size, with a fine-grained tannins lingering on the finish. Drink now–2025, and possibly beyond.
