The aromas that come together are those of scorched earth, grilled porcini, roasted coffee bean and a bit of burnt rubber. The mature palate offers dried cherry, blackberry confiture, mocha, vanilla and a hint of game alongside tongue-drying tannins that clench the finish. Give this a few years to unfold then drink sooner rather than later.
