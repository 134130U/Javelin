Though designated simply as Washington state, this five grape, Cab-dominated, Bordeaux-style blend is sourced entirely from Kiona's Red Mountain vineyards. Aromatic—almost pungent—it's built around soft, ripe red fruits, augmented with a touch of leather and toast. Round, full, and ready to drink, it spent a year in 60% new oak.
