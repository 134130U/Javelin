There's something old-fashioned about this blend of all five classic Bordeaux varieties. Partly it's the tannins, which are brusque, and partly it's the alcohol, which is low. On the other hand, the fruit is ripe in the modern style, brimming with raspberries and cherries, and there's plenty of fancy new French oak. It's a pretty wine to drink now through 2020.
