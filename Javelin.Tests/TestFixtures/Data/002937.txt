Almost instantly identifiable as a Napa Valley Cabernet for its classic black currant and cassis flavors, wrapped into sturdy tannins, and finished with acidity. The fruit is ripe and sweet, with an edge of green olives, yet the finish is thoroughly dry, with a complex spiciness. Drink now through 2020.
