Troon is going all in on Tannat, and this latest release—all estate-grown—marks a dive into natural winemaking. That means hand-picked, foot-stomped, native yeast and no additions during fermentation. Smooth, almost burnished to a fine gloss, this has dense fruit flavors of blueberry, boysenberry and blackberry. A dark streak of espresso, graphite and charcoal adds extra weight and length.
