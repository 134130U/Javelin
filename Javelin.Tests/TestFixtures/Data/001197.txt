This wine's dried pear, hay and hayflower scents create an immediate impression of richness. The palate underlines all of these generous flavors with a unique, streamlined freshness that illuminates. This is what happens when good Gr√ºner Veltliner benefits from a little bottle age: Its herbal, lifted allure comes to the fore. Savor this.
