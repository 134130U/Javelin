Purple in color and minerally and deep on the nose, this modern-style Rioja deals aromas of wood smoke, blackberry, cassis and more. The palate is big and bulky, but balance is no issue. Toasty blackberry, chocolate and coffee flavors hold onto a toasty, blackened character on a flush, dynamic finish. Drink now through 2022.
