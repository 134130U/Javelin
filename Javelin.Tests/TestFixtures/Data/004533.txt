Almost as light in color as water, this is a straight-ahead take on the grape, with tropical-leaning aromas of honeysuckle, ripe papaya and boisterous passionfruit. The palate is much grassier in style, showing cut lawn, kiwi, green pears and kaffir limes, with just a touch of lingering tropical sweetness.
