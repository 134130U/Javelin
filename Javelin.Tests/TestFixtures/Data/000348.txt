Often herbal and a bit green in nature, Silvaner is a much maligned grape. Yet at Th√∂rle, it seems to blossom into something perfumed and quite fruity, redolent of peaches and fresh pears. Characteristic herb notes are fresh and nuanced, highlighted against brisk citrus and apple flavors and a silken supple mouthfeel.
