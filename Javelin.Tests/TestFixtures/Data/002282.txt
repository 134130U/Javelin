Deep and rich aromas of blackberry syrup and wet slate kick off this excellent, approachable representation of Santa Barbara County's new Ballard Canyon appellation. It's both juicy and tannic once sipped, tasty with blackberry and slight cherry juice. Balanced with medium-range force, it provides evidence of how the region evens out Syrah's rougher edges.
