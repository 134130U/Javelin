Aromas of fragrant blue flower, menthol, spirits and plum cake lead the nose on this brawny wine. The hefty palate offers raisin, fig, vanilla, coconut and oak-driven spice alongside smooth, densely packed tannins and the warmth of alcohol. Showing the heat of the vintage, the fruit is starting to dry up so drink sooner rather than later.
