This wine shows a fine balance between sweetness (74 g/L) and acidity, reminiscent of a sp√§tlese style. Striking scents of crushed stone, beeswax and lime burst from the glass, while the flavors combine peach and citrus notes. The finish shines, marrying sugar and acid into a long, tongue-tingling finale.
