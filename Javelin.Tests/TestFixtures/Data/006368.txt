Claiming, with some pride, to have the longest chateau name in Bordeaux, this estate on the plateau of Saint-Émilion, close to Château Figeac, has given a 2014 that is dense, juicy and with great fruit. The tannins and the fruit are balanced with the blackberry flavors supported by the dry core. Drink from 2022.
