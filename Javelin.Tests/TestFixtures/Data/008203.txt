Losada is known for its red Menc√≠a, but this Godello debut is well done. A waxy floral nose with apple and stone-fruit aromas sets up a round full balanced palate with bold acidity. Salty notes accent peach and apple flavors, while this displays grip on a lingering finish. Sophisticated is a good way to describe this.
