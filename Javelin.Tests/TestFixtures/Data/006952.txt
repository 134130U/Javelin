Sourced from a dry-farmed, 40-year-old vineyard, this Zin offers aromas of red brick, cherry syrup, licorice, black sage, shaved nutmeg and nose-tickling baking spices. The grippy palate is driven by sagebrush and chemise, with ample amounts of pepper and spice giving nuance to the ripe blackberry fruit.
