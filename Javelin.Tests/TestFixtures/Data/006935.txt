This comes from one of Josh Jensen's vineyards that got barely a half-ton an acre this vintage. It offers aromas of sandalwood, leather, dried strawberry and sagebrush and is light and airy on the palate, with medium red fruits, roots and bark complexity on the midpalate. The wine finishes on nuances of hibiscus and black tea.
