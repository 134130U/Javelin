Slightly green, minty aromas of tobacco, spice, purple flower and sawdust filter onto a structured, lively palate. Flavors of dark berry fruits are accented by mint, coffee and chocolate, while the finish hits with controlled heat and herbal berry flavors. Drink this Cabernet Franc-Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmen√®re blend through 2020.
