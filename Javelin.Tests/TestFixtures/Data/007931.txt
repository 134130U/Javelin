This is winemaker Rob Folin's side project, sourcing grapes from the excellent Utopia Vineyard in the heart of the Willamette Valley. It captures the elegance, precision and depth of that specific location. Toasty, spicy and focused, it's structured around bright, deep raspberry and Bing cherry fruit. The lush baking spices are the perfect frame.
