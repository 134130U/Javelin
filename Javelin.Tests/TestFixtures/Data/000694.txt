From the renowned vineyard's F Block comes a wine with plump wild berries, pencil lead and juniper on a tightly woven nose. Certain to last for years and evolve steadily over that time, the palate now shows lavender, elderberry, elderflower, cranberry essence and a touch of black tea. Drink 2018â€“2028.
