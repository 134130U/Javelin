This is beautifully lilting in preciously defined aromas of rose petal and wild strawberry. From there, it's all subtlety and ethereal elegance. The wine is restrained, nurtured in a basket of nutmeg and graham cracker, as well as freshly packed mushroomy earth. This wine is a stunner right out of the glass, but is sure to continue its fine course through 2022â€“2025.
