Winemakers James Ontiveros and Paul Wilkins tease awesomeness out of the legendary Bien Nacido Vineyard with this Pinot Noirâ€”and Ontiveros should know how, since he worked for the vineyard for years. On the nose, there's sea salt, caramel, cotton candy and pepper-teriyaki steak. Although it's leaner on the palate, it still features ripe raspberries, milk chocolate and sweetened coffee.
