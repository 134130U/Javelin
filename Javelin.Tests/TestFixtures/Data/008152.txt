Bold and fruity, this blend is ripe, full of juicy black fruits, with a core of dry tannin. It is going to be a delicious wine with great fruitiness and attractive acidity. A mineral element at the end will allow it to develop well. This is a second wine of Jean-Michel Baudet, fifth-generation winemaker. Drink from 2018.
