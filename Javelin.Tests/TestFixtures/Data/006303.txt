This high-altitude, Chehalem Mountains vineyard puts on a show with this 2012. A sweet chocolate and cherry nose unfolds into a complex, elegant and beautifully proportioned wine, with blackberry, mineral and baking spice components. The lingering finish promises even better things to come if you give it another six to eight years in the cellar. Drink 2015 through 2025.
