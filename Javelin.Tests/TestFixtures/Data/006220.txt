Pull's well-priced portfolio delivers consistent quality, and this 54% Syrah, 27% Petite Sirah, 16% Grenache, and 3% Viognier blend is appealing, with black cherry aromas lingering amidst rose petals and mint. Blackberry juice wins the palate, with a touch of black licorice and ample yet easygoing tannins.
