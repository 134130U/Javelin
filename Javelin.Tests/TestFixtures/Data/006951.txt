The fruit came from the Glenrose Vineyard and underwent a 30-day maceration before spending three years in puncheon. The wonderful nose shows chocolate-covered dried cherries, stewed plum, sweetened leather and an almost teriyaki umami. The palate is framed by silky, fine-grained tannins with acidity that's still fresh, along with roasted game, cooked cherry and more tanned leather flavors.
