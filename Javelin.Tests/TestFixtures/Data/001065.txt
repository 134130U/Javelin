While 2010 was a great vintage in most of Spain, parts of Bierzo had a mildew problem and thus some wines are less than fully ripe. This seems to be a case in point; it's scratchy on the nose, with a sinewy, drawing mouthfeel that's only partly covered up by oak. Prickly berry and black cherry flavors finish tight, with scraping tannins. Drink now with meat or cheese.
