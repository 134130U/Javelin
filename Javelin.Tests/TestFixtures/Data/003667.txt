Dark cherry red in color, this blend of Cinsault, Grenache Noir, Syrah and Tempranillo features a bouquet of cherry with a hint of green pepper. Flavors of raspberry, pomegranate, orange peel and spearmint are set in a web of soft tannins that fully announce themselves at the mouth-coating, minty finish.
