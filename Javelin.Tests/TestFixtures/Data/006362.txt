Made entirely from Sangiovese, this elegant red boasts classic varietal aromas such as violet, red berry and new leather. On the bright, sleek palate, cinnamon and Mediterranean herb accent a juicy core of Morello cherry and crushed raspberry fruit. It's nicely balanced, with polished tannins and fresh acidity. Drink through 2025.
