For an entry-level wine, this is excellent. The aromas and flavors feature smoky, stemmy, herbal goodness layered over blueberries and black cherries, while the palate is full and supple and the finish long, silky and elegant. The quality of this wine has me looking even more forward to Torbreck's high end 2014s.
