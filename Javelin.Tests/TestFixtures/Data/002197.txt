This rich, almost sweet wine owes a lot of its exuberance to the flavors that oak barrels impartâ€”toasted, smoky, seemingly sweet but not sugary notes like maple syrup. Ripe black cherry and boysenberry flavors blend in too. The mouthfeel is dense but not harsh, as the layers of fine-textured tannins add shape without a lot of weight.
