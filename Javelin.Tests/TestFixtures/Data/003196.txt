Rounded aromas of melon and salty peaches rise to the nose on this wine from the Monterey County appellation just south of the Santa Lucia Highlands. The palate is driven by citrus, grass and a rather extreme sense of sea salt, enhanced with mouth-watering acidity and a nectarine flesh finish. It's tasty though varietally uncommon.
