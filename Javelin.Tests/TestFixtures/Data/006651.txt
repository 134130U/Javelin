Black in color and inky on the nose, this ultra-concentrated, superripe Tempranillo is smoky and toasty, with accents of graphite along with blackberry. An extracted, dense palate is braced by solid tannins and healthy acids. Blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors conclude this rich, flashy wine. Drink 2016â€“2021.
