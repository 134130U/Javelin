A bit lighter in color than other Rhône blends, certainly due to the 40% Counoise (and bolstered by 36% Mourvèdre and 24% Grenache), this offers a punchy red-currant, orange-rind and chaparral-scrub nose. Fresh cracked black pepper, cranberry-orange-plum juice and a rich earthy tone show on the palate.
