The wine comes from a parcel of land planted with both Merlot and Tannat. In its structure, this great wine has a strong connection to the Madirans that are the hallmark of this producer. With maturity, the wine has developed fine secondary flavors and undergrowth and dried-fruit flavors. The wine, named after a standing stone found in the area, is very ready to drink.
