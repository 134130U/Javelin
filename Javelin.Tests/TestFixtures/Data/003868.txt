Though reserved in the nose, this wine from a vineyard to the west of the Sta. Rita Hills already presents a bit of aromatic age, with honey, almond and dried apricot. It's lean, bright and flinty once sipped, with gravel, tangerine pith and chamomile, proving to be a refreshing sipper that never tires. Drink now.
