Faint hints of aromatic tart cherry try to burst through the closed nose. The fruit is present on the fresh palate with astonishing purity. There is real concentration and a richer, almost plush texture at the core despite the svelte nature of this wine. A real triumph that expresses pure aromatic red cherry with real elegance. This has beauty, charm, length and authenticity.
