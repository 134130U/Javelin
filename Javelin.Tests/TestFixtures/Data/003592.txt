You'll find aromas of dried orchard fruit, beeswax, Spanish broom, acacia and an earthy note on this spry nine-year-old. On the mature, waxy palate, fruit flavors have given way to tertiary sensations of honey, toasted nut, candied citrus zest and flinty mineral that carry through the to lingering finish. A saline note signals the close.
