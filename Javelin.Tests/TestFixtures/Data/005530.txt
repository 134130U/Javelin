With attractive juiciness, this ripe wine has plenty of room for both tannins and black fruits. It is fruity, acidity topping the berry flavors and bringing in toast and final spice. Heather van Ekris, owner of this estate that began as a Middle Ages convent, brought in Hubert de Brouard of Château Angelus in Saint-Émilion as consultant beginning with this vintage. Drink from 2017.
