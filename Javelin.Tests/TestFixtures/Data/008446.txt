Ripe, muscular aromas of forest floor, blackberry, cassis and violet are stunningly attractive. This is showing vise-grip tannins in support of blackberry, licorice, mocha and woodspice flavors. Café mocha and an oaky, creamy note of toffee work the finish on this well-structured wine that should be drunk from 2015–2025.
