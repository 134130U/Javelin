Winemaker Mike Mooney adds complexity with 16% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8% Merlot on this bottling, which shows blueberries, crushed black rocks and dark chocolate on the nose, but doesn't offer a lot of Cab Francness. The palate does offer some, however, with grippy tannins and dried oregano touches laid across rich black cherry, blueberry, fudge and espresso notes.
