A blend of 70% Petit Verdot and 30% Cesanese, this opens with aromas of scorched earth, smoke, black-skinned fruit, coconut and a touch of exotic spice. The silky, weightless palate delivers concentrated black cherry, blackberry, mineral and Asian spice alongside silky, smooth tannins. The smoky notes are unusual, and originate from a fire that raged near the vineyards in 2012, but nonetheless add to the wine's depth and character.
