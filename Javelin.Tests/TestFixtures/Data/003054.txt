There is just a touch of peach amidst the green and yellow apple notes. The palate adds a stony earthy touch, as well as a hint of lanoline, and has an impressive core of fruit that radiates throughout this wine with pure apple flavor and crisp freshness. This strikes a high soprano note of absolute purity. The body is taut and bone-dry, the finish is clean and lasting. Gorgeous now but totally built to last. Drink now through 2035.
