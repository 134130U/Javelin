A blend of 73% Petite Sirah with 17% Zinfandel, this is a black, inky wine, as to be expected, from Spring Mountain's longstanding York Creek Vineyard. Dusty, earthy and mouthfilling, it is out and out savory. Tastes of black pepper and gamy oak lead to a lingering finish marked by more peppery spice.
