The extremely cool-climate Presqu'ile Vineyard delivers an exciting wine, with herb-bomb nose aromas of oregano, thyme, grass and rosemary, with a bit of green apple fruit on the background. There is peppery verve to the palate, where the wine bounces off the tongue with flavors of lime zest, Granny Smith apple and cut grass. It's almost spicy.
