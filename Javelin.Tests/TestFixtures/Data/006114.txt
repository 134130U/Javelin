A for effort, B for delivery on this 100% Cabernet. It shows those famous Howell Mountain tannins, and the flavors are concentrated in blackberries and black currants. An elusive minerality gives the mouthfeel a hard, stony resistance, beyond the tannins. It doesn't seem likely that the fruit will outlast the hardness, so drink up, after a long time in the decanter.
