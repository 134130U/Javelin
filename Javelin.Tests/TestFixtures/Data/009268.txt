Ideal Albari√±o aromas of buttercup, orange blossom, mild citrus, peach and seashell set up a mature but fresh palate, with layered complexity and minerality to spare. Flavorwise, this is a touch waxy, with an emphasis on pear, peach and melon. A dry, clean, slightly dusty finish sends this off in fine fashion.
