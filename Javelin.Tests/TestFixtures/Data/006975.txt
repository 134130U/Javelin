Blackberry, cassis, tire rubber and black olive aromas include a note of vanilla. In the mouth, this cool-vintage Crianza is pinching and tannic. Berry and vanilla flavors are solid but not evolved, while this feels tight, tannic and raw on the finish. Given how cool 2013 was, this is fairly generous. Drink through 2022.
