A 100% Cabernet Sauvignon from the M5 block of Stagecoach Vineyard, the producer's own estate, this offers notes of pipe tobacco and tar, with shades of pencil lead and cedar bearing down on the palate. It's mouthfilling, with ample acidity showing through in the background followed by a long finish. Cellar through 2026.
