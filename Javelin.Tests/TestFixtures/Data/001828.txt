From what is now an estate property, once known as the Nugent Vineyard, Winside is brawny and brooding in wild strawberry compote, dark plum, blackberry and an inviting lushness. High-toned acidity keeps it from becoming overly dense on the palate. Strong tannin on the finish reflects a high-tannin vintage overall.
