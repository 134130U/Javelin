Slightly pink in color, this Pinot Noir-based sparkler brings appealing notes of orange blossom and pink lemonade, nearing but not quite reaching bubble-gum tropicality. It's riper than its sister Blanc de Blancs, but remains very high and tight, enlivening the mouth with acidity and sour plum flavors.
