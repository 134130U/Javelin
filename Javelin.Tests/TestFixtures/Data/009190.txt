Taurasi Radici is a compelling wine that opens with a multifaceted fragrance of freshly tilled earth, iris, leather, tar and mature black berries. The gripping palate delivers ripe black cherry and plum layered with white pepper, clove and mocha, alongside fresh acidity and polished tannins. It's already accessible but hold for even more complexity. Best 2018â€“2028.
