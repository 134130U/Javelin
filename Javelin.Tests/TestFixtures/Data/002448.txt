A fragrant and pure nose of slightly floral tangerine peel opens this wine. It offers a ripe fruit-driven dance of aromas and freshness—think tangerine, ripe lemon, crisp apple and a beguiling floral dimension. Lovely now in its primary-flavored youth, it's certain to become even more disarming in the future. Drink 2020–2035 or later if you like it really mature.
