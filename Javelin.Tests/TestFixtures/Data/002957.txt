Lighter in color, this wine comes from the Miller family that owns Bien Nacido Vineyard. Aromas combine brisk raspberry and fresh strawberry with clove. There is a bitterness on the palate akin to saut√©ed beet greens, followed by pepper spice and more raspberry, with tannins that may evolve over time.
