This well-crafted wine is reflective of the vintage, which brought its share of challenges. Tea-leaf flavors run throughout, along with quite light red fruits and plenty of acid. The finish is on the green side, but not so much that it's detrimental. Drink this wine while cellaring the bigger wines from riper years.
