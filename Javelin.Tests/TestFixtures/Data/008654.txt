This is a single-vineyard wine, one of a range of three Rieslings from Schoenheitz. It is attractively perfumed with white flowers and fruit blossom. The acidity and zesty texture balance the off-dry flavors. Crisp apples add to the fresh-while-structured character. Drink now, although it will be better from 2016.
