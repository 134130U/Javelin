A brick color on the rim agrees with very tasty and mature flavors to indicate this wine should be enjoyed now. It smells like dried leaves on the forest floor, and tastes rather beefy and savory in flavor with hints of Worcestershire sauce and balsamic vinegar. It is medium to full bodied and smooth in texture.
