Graphite, maple and other oaky aromas dominate this lush, pitch-black Tinto Fino. A chewy, dense mouthfeel is rich as an oil baron, while oak-driven flavors of vanilla and baking spices accent blackberry and cassis. On the finish, this is monster-sized and full of blue-fruit deliciousness. Drink through 2020.
