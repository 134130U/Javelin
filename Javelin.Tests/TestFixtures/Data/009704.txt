Ferguson is L'Ecole's newest estate vineyard, and this Bordeaux-style blend marks its single-vineyard debut. It's 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 32% Merlot and 11% Cabernet Franc, grown at 1,500 feet in almost pure basalt. The minerality is a signature trait, along with raspberry, cassis and wild cherry fruit flavors. This seems sure to improve by 2020â€“2022.
