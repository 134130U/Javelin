This is an exceptional Zinfandel from a renowned site, as famous for Pinot Noir and Chardonnay as it has now become for Zin. Heady aromas of raspberry, blackberry and boysenberry tease before coming to life on the palate, accented by a delightful complement of allspice and juicy acidity. Medium bodied, it's incredibly easy to enjoy and rich in all the right ways.
