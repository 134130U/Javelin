This is a power-packed blend of 72% Syrah, 15% Grenache, 8% Petite Sirah and 5% Mourv√®dre, with smoky aromas of game, bacon fat, pressed blackberry, pepper and baking spices. The palate is oak-driven, with flavors of smoked meats in boysenberry sauce, but the tannins are so strong that this needs until at least 2018 for the components to shine properly.
