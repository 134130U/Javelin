Flush on the nose, this huge, modern Rioja is loaded with cassis, blackberry and cola aromas. The palate is bold, tannic and flush, with fierceness playing off against lushness. Savory blackberry, hickory and controlled saltiness drive the flavor profile toward a roasted, spicy, blackened finish that's rugged and suggests a long life for this wine. Drink 2016â€“2024.
