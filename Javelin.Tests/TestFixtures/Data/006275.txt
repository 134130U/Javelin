Wild strawberry and a soft layering of fresh earth form the core of this blend, based mostly on Cabernet Sauvignon, with a healthy dose of Merlot and then smaller supporting handfuls of Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot. Blackberries come to fore as the wine develops, along with a swathe of bittersweet chocolate.
