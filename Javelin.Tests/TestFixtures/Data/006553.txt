This is an intense, extreme wine made from Nerello Mascalese vines planted in the 1940s. It's handcrafted, with no selected yeasts or added sulfites, and aged in terra cotta vessels. It's loaded with smoky mineral, concentrated black cherry, black pepper, cinnamon and notes of balsamic herbs framed by solid, velvety tannins. The only criticism is a slight fizzy sensation, but total perfection isn't what this wine is about.
