This aromatic Priorat is 72% Carignan and the rest Garnacha. Aromas of floral bath soap, cinnamon and cedar accent plum and berry scents. In the mouth, this is built like a tank. Spicy chocolaty black-plum and cassis flavors finish chewy and thick, with notes of mint and licorice. Drink through 2021.
