This vineyard, first planted in 1982, was recently acquired by Jason Lett. A steely, earthy core provides the spine, wrapped in tart red currant fruit. Firm and focused, it's a multi-dimensional effort that still shows well after being open for three full days. Berries, smoke, dark chocolate, a whiff of curry and a saline finish are all in play.
