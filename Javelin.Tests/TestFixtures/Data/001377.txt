This rich, youthful wine is another example of Lugana that is aging gracefully and has more to give. It opens with aromas of citrus, dried apricots and flint that carry over to the palate together with lemon drop, grapefruit and pear, plus fresh acidity. A mineral note marks the start of the long finish. Drink now through 2018.
