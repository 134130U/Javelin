The Eichberg vineyard, one of the driest in Alsace, is on a gentle southeast-facing slope. This Gewurztraminer shows the opulent style of wines that are typically produced. It is rich and generous, developing cinnamon and nutmeg flavors balanced by superripe tropical fruits. It still has a way to go, so drink from 2017.
