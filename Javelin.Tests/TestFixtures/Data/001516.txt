Bryan Babcock makes plenty of more expensive Pinot Noirs, but this appellation blend hits all the right notes and shows off the results of the “pedestular cane suspension” technique he's been using in the vineyard. Wild thyme, sagebrush and bay leaf meet cranberry and slate aromas on the nose. Black raspberry and cranberry flavors lead the earthy palate, accented with nettle and peppercorn.
