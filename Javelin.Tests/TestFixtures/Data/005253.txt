The winery behind America's first Petite Sirah continues pumping out quaffable bottles, including this show of black plums, pressed violets, black raspberries, white pepper, licorice candy and dill on the nose. The palate offers boysenberries and baked oregano, with a tapenade-like zing on the finish.
