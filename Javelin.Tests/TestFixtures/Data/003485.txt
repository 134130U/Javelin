In this vintage, the winery stays true to its reputation for making balanced, more restrained Cabernet, offering firm, structured tannins and bright cassis and blackberry around a deft sprinkling of dried herb. Built to age through 2025, it is equally enjoyable now, after a decant. Small percentages of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Malbec factor in.
