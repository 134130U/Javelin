Close to the Luberon hills and therefore outside the main Provence wine region, this 30-acre estate is in wild country. This blend of Grenache and Mourvèdre is crisp, with a strong mineral undertone. It has ripe red berry fruits that are lifted by the citrus acidity. The wine is tight, and nervy, just right for some Provençal food.
