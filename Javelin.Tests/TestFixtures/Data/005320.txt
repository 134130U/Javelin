The nose of this wine is somewhat reduced, signalling that it needs to breathe. The palate is zesty and comes with a wonderfully grippy but taut phenolic texture, lending structure to its slim body of green and yellow apple fruit with riper notions of yellow plum and peach. The finish is clean, dry and refreshing.
