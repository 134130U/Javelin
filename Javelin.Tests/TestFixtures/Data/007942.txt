The grapes for this limited-production wine come from the outstanding Alloro vineyard. The texture and complexity are immediately apparent. Mouthcoating plum and cherry fruit combines with lively citrus, toasty oak and a rich chocolate note. Drink now or put some away for a few years, but don't miss this one.
