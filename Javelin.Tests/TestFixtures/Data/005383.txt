Fresh and linear, this opens with fragrant purple flower, red berry and new leather scents. The firm, youthfully austere palate is loaded with finesse, offering crunchy red cherry, fresh strawberry and licorice notes with taut, fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity. Give it time to unwind and fully develop. Drink 2019â€“2028.
