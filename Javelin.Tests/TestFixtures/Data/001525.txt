Though labeled Willamette Valley, this is single vineyard Chehalem Mountains AVA fruit. Smooth, ripe and buttery, from sniff to swallow, it's loaded with Satsuma orange, Meyer lemon and pink-grapefruit flavors. The acids snap and the finish lingers, with a streak of vanilla and a slight sensation of heat.
