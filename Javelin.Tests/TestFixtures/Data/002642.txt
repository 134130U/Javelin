Dark red-violet in the glass, this blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Grenache has a nose of black cherry, green pepper and cocoa. It may be a little too cool for some tastes, but bright fruit and slightly luxurious tannins make up for the fennel and eucalyptus flavors that are joined on the palate by cherry, pomegranate and orange zest. The smooth finish goes completely cool for a second but winds up in a burst of bright fruit.
