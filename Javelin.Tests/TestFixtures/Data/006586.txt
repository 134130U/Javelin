This warm, robust expression of Sangiovese opens with aromas of underbrush, scorched soil and mature black-skinned fruit. The densely extracted, monolithic palate offers blackberry extract, coffee and black pepper alongside raspy tannins that leave an astringent finish. It lacks fruit richness and freshness. You'll also notice the heat of evident alcohol on the finish.
