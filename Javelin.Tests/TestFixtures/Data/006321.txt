Always one of the finest expressions of Nero d'Avola, this polished, delicious wine opens with enticing aromas of blue flower, dark berry and a whiff of smoky graphite. The smooth, almost creamy palate doles out layers of blackberry, pomegranate, raspberry, white pepper, carob and licorice, while velvety tannins and fresh acidity provide support. Drink through 2021.
