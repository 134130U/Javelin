Melon, peach and honeysuckle swirl together on the very ripe nose, thanks to the blend of 42% Viognier, 24% Marsanne, 21% Grenache Blanc, 11% Roussanne and 2% Picpoul Blanc. Tropical fruits also power the peachy palate, yet it finishes crisply with a mineral sharpness, smartly combining the warm climate yet unique soils of the appellation.
