This wine is estate-grown and from a single one-acre vineyard, entirely varietal and quite impressive. Soft, integrated tannins and oak are present but behaved, allowing for deeply satisfying layers of black olive, blackberry and bittersweet chocolate to evolve and intermingle on the palate. Big boned, this wine shows balance and complexity.
