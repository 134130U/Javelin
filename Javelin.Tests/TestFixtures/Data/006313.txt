Heady, rich, balsamic aromas fold in attractive notes of cedar, tobacco and black cherry in front of a fully ripe, superbly balanced palate that nails it in terms of structure. Mocha, espresso, fudge and blackberry flavors finish with spicy, mossy, dry notes and a final wave of blackened toast and tannins. Best from 2017â€“2022.
