Owned by the Borie family, one of the grand families of Bordeaux, the vineyard forms part of Ch√¢teau Fourcas-Borie. The wine, with its dark tannins and dense texture, is powerful and concentrated. Layers of tannins show most strongly at this young stage, while the ripe juicy fruit will develop well. It is going to be a fine wine. Drink from 2021.
