A dark nose of black tobacco, condensed violets, soy, black pepper, black plum and aromatic wood shows on the nose of this wine from a longtime Paso estate, now owned by the Foley family. The palate offers an intriguing sense of black pepper and dried violets, followed by lavender, thyme, rosemary and elderberry laid across fine-grained but structured tannins.
