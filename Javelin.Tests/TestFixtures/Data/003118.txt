Beautiful, ripe fruit flavors light up this full-bodied but silky-textured wine. It leaves an almost-sweet impression, as layers of blackberry, raspberry and strawberry coat the palate and linger on the finish. The texture is almost syrupy because the wine is so rich, making it a great pairing for chocolate or aged cheese.
