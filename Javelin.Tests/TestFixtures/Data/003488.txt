This wine was made by Bordeaux-trained winemaker Denis Malbec and his wife, sommelier May-Britt Malbec. They've sourced some exceptional fruit from the Reichel Vineyard, including some Malbec, with some Cabernet Franc also blended in. Offering big tannins that await the cellar, it is otherwise a juicy wine rich in black and blue berry fruit, as well as a taste of graham cracker and cigar. Enjoy through 2025.
