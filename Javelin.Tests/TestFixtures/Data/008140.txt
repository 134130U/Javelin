This approachable Zinfandel comes from a modern-day vineyard planted with cuttings from pre-Prohibition-era vines and exhibits the complexity these heritage grapes can offer. Smoky and exuberant in cherry and blackberry fruit, the wine has soft tannins and a rounded feel to the palate, its long finish smooth and meaty.
