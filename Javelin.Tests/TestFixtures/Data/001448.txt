Always an eye-opening bottling, this blends 50% Sangiovese with 50% Syrah. This vintage shows cooked blackberries, baked plums, balsamic vinaigrette and black rocks on the nose. The palate is juicy and energetic, blending dark fruit with bright acidity, coffee and caramel flavors, with strong tannins for structure.
