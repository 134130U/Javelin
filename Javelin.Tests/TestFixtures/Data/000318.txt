The wine comes from the grand showpiece estate of Madiran. A blend that is dominated by Tannat produces a wine that is still so young. Bold fruits and firm tannins are right to the fore, along with acidity and a strong mineral texture. It's a powerful and impressive wine that also manages elegance as well. The wine will take several more years to soften. Drink from 2020.
