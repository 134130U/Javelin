Structured and balanced, this wine has great fruits that go with the tannins and rich texture. There is an unusually low amount of Merlot (60%) with 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Cabernet Franc for the area, yet there is a strongly juicy feel to the wine that gives a generous side. It is developing well; drink from 2016.
