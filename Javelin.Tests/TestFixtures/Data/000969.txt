Raisin and white pepper aromas, ripe fruit, floral and spicy anise flavors and full body add up to a big wine in which the whole-cluster fermentation method can be tasted. The hearty flavors, complexity and firm tannins paint a unique picture, and this bottling makes a dramatic contrast in style from the “regular” Anderson Valley Pinot Noir.
