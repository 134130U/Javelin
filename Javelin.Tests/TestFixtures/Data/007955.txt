Plush blackberry, fennel, mocha, char and peppercorn aromas show on the nose of this bottling from longtime friends Paul Quinn and James Schreiner. Dried plum skin, cherry and elderberry flavors show on the palate, which is layered with tannins and turns savory with charred beef, charcoal and tobacco flavors.
