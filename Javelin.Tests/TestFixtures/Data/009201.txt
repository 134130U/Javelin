Start packing your cellar with 2010 Ribera gems like this wine, which is offering graphite and minerally plum and berry aromas in front of a full-bodied, hard-driving palate. Ripe, extracted blackberry and lightly herbal flavors finish with tons of residual weight and tannins. This is loud, burly and delicious; drink from 2016â€“2030.
