A lovely purity of lemon oil and zest pervades both nose and palate of this straight-laced wine. There is purity and freshness, precision and tons of zesty tangy lemon. This finds its counterpoint in a lovely texture of stone and chalk. Later, ripe apple notes make an aromatic experience and stay on the dry palate all the way through the long lemony finish.
