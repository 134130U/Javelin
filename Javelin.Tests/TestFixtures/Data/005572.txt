An unusual and full-bodied wine, this is a very deep red in color, smells perfumey and plummy, and tastes floral, ripe and extravagant. After dinner, it would make a good accompaniment to blue cheese and toasted walnuts. The wine was made with dried grapes in a style traditional for Amarone wines in Italy.
