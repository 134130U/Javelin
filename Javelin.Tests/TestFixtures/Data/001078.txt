Aromas of ripe plum, rose petals, cake spices and toasted oak lead the nose on this structured wine. The rich palate opens with a burst of dark cherry fruit followed by accents of roasted coffee bean, espresso, and vanilla. The succulent midpalate is cut short by astringent wood tannins that leave the mouth feeling dried out.
