Bright aromas of raspberry and dried rose petals highlight this wine from the southwestern corner of the county, along with black tea, sage and shiitake mushrooms. The flavors are supple and elegant, with light strawberry, pencil shavings and sagebrush making for a fun, energetic wine that really lets the vineyard shine.
