Aromas of earthy, nutty, mature berry fruits come with a hint of raisin and a touch of compost. This saturated Vino de CÃ¡diz is composed of 80% Syrah, with Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. It's a heavy wine with flavors of vanilla, burnt wood, blackened spices and stewed berries. The finish tastes peppery, dark and outright woody. Drink through 2019.
