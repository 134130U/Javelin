A blend of 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 18% Cabernet Franc and 7% Petit Verdot, this well-structured red offers ripe dark-skinned berry, underbrush and graphite aromas. The concentrated, savory palate delivers black currant, white pepper and soothing licorice flavors and fine tannins. Enjoy through 2023.
