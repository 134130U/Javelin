Made by the vine guru of Ventura County, Bruce Freeman, this bottling from a stunning coastal site shows plump red currant, tangy red plum skin and wet slate mineral scents. There's an Earl Grey tea touch to the palate, with lavender floral notes, peppery spice, dark red fruit and a bright acidity that persists into the finish.
