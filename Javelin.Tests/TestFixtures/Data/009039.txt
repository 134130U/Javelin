Lusciously ripe black and red cherry fruit is abundant; its flavors pervade everything and speak to the ripeness of the 2015 vintage. Yet, the palate is balanced with enough freshness to make this a very enjoyable, juicy wine. Pack it in your picnic basket or chill it for a lovely bit of Austrian sunshine in your glass.
