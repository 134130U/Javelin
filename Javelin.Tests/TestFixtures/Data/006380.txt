This wine from Champagne native Christian Roguenant hits all the right Pinot notes with aplomb. Fragrant cherry blossom and red fruit aromas are spiced with mace and loamy earth notes. The palate combines rich red fruit with touches of earth and baking spice, manages to stay light and refreshing in body.
