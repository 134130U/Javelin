Aromas of French oak, coconut, vanilla and spiced plum lead the nose on this powerfully structured wine. The oak sensations carry over to the warm palate along with cherry marinated in spirits, licorice and menthol. Bracing, close-grained tannins provide the framework and need time to unwind. Best after 2020.
