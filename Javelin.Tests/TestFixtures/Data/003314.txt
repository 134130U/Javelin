This winery has specialized in Cabernet Franc for 20 years, and seems to have kicked up the concentration in recent vintages. This potent wine was tight and tannic when first opened, but developed nicely over 24 hours. It has a smoky, peppery element in the aroma that segues to dark berry flavors. It will improve through at least 2019.
