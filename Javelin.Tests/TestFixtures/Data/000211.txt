Blue flower, ripe berry, baking spice and mint aromas lead the nose on this full-bodied, elegant wine. The palate delivers juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, licorice and mineral alongside firm, ripe tannins. It's young but already displays a great combination of structure and finesse.
