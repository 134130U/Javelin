The winery's reserve-level bottling, this has the extra concentration to warrant the designation. Tart young berry/cherry fruit carries the brunt of the midpalate. The barrel treatment is delicately balanced, bringing in nuances of toast, coconut and almond. Very well made, and cellarworthy. Drink now through 2025.
