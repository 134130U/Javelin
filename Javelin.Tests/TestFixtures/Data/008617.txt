This Dundee Hills vineyard really shines in 2012, with multi-layered flavors of sweet, spicy, slightly candied fruits. Kirsch, orange peel, smoke and sandalwood play against each other, with a citrus kick to the underlying acidity. Bright and focused through a long finish, this is one to tuck away for a few years. Drink 2017â€“2025.
