Certified French organic with this vintage, this 100% Merlot is ripe, full-bodied and already showing its potential richness. Terroir-driven black fruits and generous tannins give a warm character to the wine that is then backed by black fruits and final acidity. This is a generous wine from the Verdier family, ready to age. Drink from 2018.
