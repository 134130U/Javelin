Minerally white-fruit aromas lack specificity. This is fresh but standard in feel, with briny flavors of nectarine, apple, citrus pith and nut skins. A dilute finish is fresh but thin. Why this blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Air√©n and Verdejo costs what it does is beyond comprehension because it smells, tastes and feels generic.
