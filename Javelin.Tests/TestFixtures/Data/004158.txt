Napoleon's secret was that he liked Syrah in his Bordeaux blends, so this mix of 46% Cabernet Sauvignon, 23% Syrah, 13% Cabernet Franc, 12% Merlot, 4% Malbec and 2% Petit Verdot shows why, offering fresh and vibrant aromas of blueberry and licorice candy. Bright blackberry preserves pop on the palate as does fudge in this easy-drinking wine.
