Jaboulet's Condrieu program takes a huge step forward with this release, which artfully combines barrel fermentation and aging with just-ripe Viognier into a compelling and cohesive whole. The toast and baking-spice elements provide the right amount of restraint to the tropical fruit notes, which then finish with tremendous, mouthwatering length. Drink nowâ€“2020.
