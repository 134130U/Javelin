At almost two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a dark, intense, cassis-laden wine. It's full-bodied and richly textured, with obvious cellaring potential of at least 7 or 8 years. Dark chocolate and gentle coffee notes creep in on the midpalate, while the long, mouthwatering finish features layers of soft tannins.
