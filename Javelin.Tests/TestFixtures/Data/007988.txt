This white Rh√¥ne blend places Grenache Blanc at center stage, with Marsanne, Picpoul Blanc and Viognier playing supporting roles. It's fresh and engaging on the nose, suggesting caramelized pear, apple blossom and chalk. Laser-sharp acidity and chalky minerality balance bold lime custard and apple skin flavors.
