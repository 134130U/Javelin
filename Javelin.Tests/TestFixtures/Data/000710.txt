Cabernet Sauvignon makes up just over half of this blend with the rest Cabernet Franc and Merlot. Vanilla and cocoa aromas are out in front of herb, black licorice and dark fruit. The dark-fruit and woodspice flavors are refined and show a sense of depth, elegance and balance that captures the attention.
