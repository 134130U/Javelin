Roughly half and half Stermer Vineyard and Meyer Vineyard fruit is selected for this reserve blend. It's a deep-diving wine that pushes precise flavors of black cherry, licorice, vanilla and espresso front and center. A hint of truffle comes up in the finish, and the overall structure and balance are spot-on. You could cellar this for a few more years, but it's already drinking very nicely, so why wait?
