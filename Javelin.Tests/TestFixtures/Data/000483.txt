This Sangiovese opens with aromas of blue flowers, underbrush, dark-skinned berry and a whiff of roasted coffee beans, all of which carry over to the concentrated palate along with black pepper and clove. The tannins are still tightly wound but drink sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit richness.
