This is by no means a shy wine and yet it is deceptively subtle at first, offering fresh lemon and tangerine aromas behind a first whiff of jasmine. With a complexity of briny sea breeze subtlety, it ventures into caramel and oaky nutmeg, remaining balanced and layered all the while. Enjoyable now, this wine will blossom further through 2018.
