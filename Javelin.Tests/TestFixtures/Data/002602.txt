From the property of a longtime vineyard manager for the winery, this bottling is deliciously unique. The nose abounds with earth, dried cherry, anise, roasted meat and herb aromas. The structure is solid and somewhat gripping, presenting deep red-fruit flavors with dried herb accents, driven by balanced acidity.
