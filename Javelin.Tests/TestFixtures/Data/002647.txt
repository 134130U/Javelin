This cool-vintage blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc brings light aromas of woodspice, and dried and fresh herbs, with dark cherries lurking in the background. The acids are bright and tart, while the tannins bring some grit, with coffee flavors lingering on the finish. It needs time to come together.
