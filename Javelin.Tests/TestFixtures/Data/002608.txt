Char and wood grain are prominent on a smoky nose with blackberry and black-currant aromas. Intense tannins and layered depth make for a full palate, while this tastes ripe and toasty, with blackberry and chocolate flavors. On the finish, mild herbal complexity mixed with latent oak are stirring. Drink through 2026.
