While the wine is all tannin and structure at this stage, the weight and rich fruit promise plenty of good aging potential. Wine producers for 10 generations, the Dulon family picks specific plots. This 60% Merlot, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cabernet France blend has juicy black fruits that will push forward to give a full wine with a fine presence. Drink from 2017.
