Father-and-son vintners Joe and Sam Miller consistently deliver solid wines, including this twist-top Merlot that's aged in 50% new French oak. Its boysenberry fruit is awash in the green peppercorn, herb and crushed graphite character associated with the mountainous region. That pyrazine touch hits the palate, along with black pepper and dark chocolate spice, accenting the tangy red fruit.
