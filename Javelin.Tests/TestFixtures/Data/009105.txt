Ken Wright produces as many as a dozen or more single-vineyard Pinots in any given vintage. This wine is blended from many of those same sites, whose vines were often planted back in the 1980s. It's light and elegant, yet powerfully flavorful, with strawberry, raspberry and cherry fruit pushing deep into the palate. It's clean and fresh, with crisp defining acidity, perfect balance, refined tannins and a long finish. Best of all, it's widely available.
