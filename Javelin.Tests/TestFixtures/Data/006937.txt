John and Helen Falcone's annual offering of this nonvintage blend of Syrah, Petite Sirah and Cabernet Sauvignon offers aromas of smoky cedar, cherry liqueur, mint and fresh-ground coffee. It's ripe and inviting right away on the palate, with blackberry extract and black licorice flavors, which benefit from acidity and soft tannins that emerge on the midpalate.
