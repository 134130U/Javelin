This is such a good Pinot, and so reflective of the Sonoma Coast, that its price makes it a steal. With low alcohol and brisk acidity, it's translucent in color, with a gleaming ruby hue. The mouthfeel is silky and delicate, yet the raspberry, cola and buttered cinnamon toast flavors are intense. Drink nowâ€“2020.
