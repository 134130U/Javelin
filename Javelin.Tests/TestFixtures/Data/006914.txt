The nose on this wine from regional pioneer Gary Eberle is reserved at first, then releases seared lemon, tightly wound stone fruit, soft butter and caramel nibs. There is a pleasant weight on the medium-density palate, with sour-leaning flavors of Granny Smith apple peels, lime rinds and some riper honeydew melon.
