From one of the most ocean-adjacent vineyards in the state, this is a swarthy and powerful bottling, showing black plum, violet, olive and coffee touches on the concentrated nose. There is a bracing acidity and upright structure to the palate, while the flavors remain power-driven: stewed plum and hoisin sauce, with an espresso-like finish.
