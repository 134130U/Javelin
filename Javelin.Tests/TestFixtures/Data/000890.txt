This is the second vintage release for the estate vineyard, which occupies the highest planted portion of Red Mountain. Precise, sharp-edged, high-acid red-fruit flavors of berry and cherry seem stacked vertically, with a strong mineral underpinning. The alcohol is a bit high, but overall the structure holds together and would support further aging; drink nowâ€“2022.
