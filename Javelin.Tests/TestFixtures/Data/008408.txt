Named in honor of North Carolina's first commercial winery and a woman born in the 1500s in the Lost Colony of Roanoke, this white is floral in kumquat and toffee, a mix of rich and robust that's tropical in personality. Tangy acidity closes out the finish, revealing the toasty oak it inhabited for a year.
