A brand new vineyard designation for the winery, Bedrock dates to the 1800s and is being made famous by proprietor Joel Peterson of Ravenswood and his son, Morgan Twain Peterson. This wine does the site justice, a smooth concoction of cherry pit and allspice, elegant and yet plenty generous in fruit and structure, measured by natural acidity.
