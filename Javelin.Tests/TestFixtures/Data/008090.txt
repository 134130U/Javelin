Inky red-purple in color and thick, this is a powerfully impressive Cabernet from the mighty Monte Rosso Vineyard. It's rich in spicy cinnamon, deep, dark plum and herbal tobacco. With the acidity in balance, it offers huge leather up front, dotted by undertones of cedar and pencil shavings. The finish is deftly accented by a seasoning of black pepper that lingers on the tongue.
