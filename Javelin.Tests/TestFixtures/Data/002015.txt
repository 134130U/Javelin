This blend of 44% Cabernet Sauvignon, 34% Malbec and 22% Petit Verdot is rich and layered on the nose with black-cherry, blueberry, dark-chocolate and roasted-beef aromas. The palate kicks off with a touch of mint, then offers thick blueberry, coffee syrup and soy flavors. The structure is still quite sticky, and will open with time.
