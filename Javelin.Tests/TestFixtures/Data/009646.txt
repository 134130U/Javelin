Consistently among the best $20-and-under wines each vintage, this blend of 52% Grenache, 44% Syrah and 4% Tempranillo from vintner Dan Lee delivers plump boysenberry, plum, baking spice and rosemary scents on the nose. The palate is dry and herbal yet bright with acidity, full of thyme and sagebrush notes against a backdrop of plum fruit.
