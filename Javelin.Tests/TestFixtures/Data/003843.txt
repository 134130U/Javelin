Red apple aromas form the core with pear and yellow melon on the fringes of this stainless steel Chardonnay from Lompoc's Kenneth “Joey” Gummere. The tart green apple and pear skin acidity is expected, but it retains a full body—a prime example of a stainless Chard that's sleek but not overly austere.
