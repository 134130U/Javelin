There is much buzz about this new Steve and Chrystal Clifton (of Palmina and Brewer-Clifton) project that finds inspiration for wine from music. This orange-mauve-pink ros√© is redolent with the familiar Pinot components of cherry, sagebrush and clove. On the palate, iron, graphite and wild herbs spice up the pomegranate fruit. It's very varietally pure.
