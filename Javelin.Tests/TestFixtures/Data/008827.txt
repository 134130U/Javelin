An earthy, Indian-inspired spice rack of scents like star anise, cardamom and cedar surround a black cherry backbone on this single vineyard offering from the Corralitos area south of Santa Cruz, overlooking the Monterey Bay. The nuanced experience continues to the palate, where a core of sour cherry is layered with herbs of thyme and oregano, followed by a minty finish.
