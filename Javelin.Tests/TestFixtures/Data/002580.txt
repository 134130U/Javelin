Cinnamon and crushed blackberry appear in equeal measure on the nose of this wine. The palate presents juicy, ripe but still wonderfully tart fruit, with a touch of pepper around the edges. The aftertaste reveals fine, smooth and firm tannins and a lip-smacking, well-judged freshness. A joyful combination.
