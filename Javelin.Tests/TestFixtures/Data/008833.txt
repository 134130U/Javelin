Perhaps the best Sizeranne I've ever tasted, the 2010 displays extra levels of richness and structure. Plum and coffee-bean notes are lightened and brightened by hints of cherries and raspberries that linger easily on the velvety finish. Delicious already, it should continue to drink well through at least 2020.
