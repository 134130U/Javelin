Apparently the Oregon Trail leads down to Santa Rosa, where this wine was cellared and bottled. Long-distance travel aside, it's a good wine for gulping, matching red currant fruit to a generous wash of black tea and tobacco. Flavors pull up a bit short, but by then the next swallow is already on the way.
