Fruit is sourced from Bismark Vineyard in the Moon Mountain District. Compared with the winery's Winemaker's Cuvée, this combines Cabernet Sauvignon (83%) with a larger percentage of Malbec (17%). It spends the same amount of time—two years—in French oak, but slightly less of it is new. The flavors are more approachable, still dark, massive and spicy, the taste of oak slightly sweet.
