From a popular vineyard on the eastern edge of the appellation, this wine offers aromas of cherry, cola, slate, orange rind and cinnamon stick. The palate is light but bursting with herbal character and sizzling acidity. It shows fresh oregano and thyme alongside tart pomegranate fruit in the midpalate. A eucalyptus quality extends into the finish.
