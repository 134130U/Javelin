A small planting of an unusual “Upright” clone yields this fragrant, smoky, lightly earthy Pinot Noir. Chock full of briary red fruits, it's a tart, lip-smacking wine, drinking well in its youth, but also positioned (via bracing acidity) for further years of bottle age. The young fruit gives a pretty, cherry candy note to the finish.
