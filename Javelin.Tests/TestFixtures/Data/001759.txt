Coffee, toast, nut, forest floor and fleshy plum aromas waft out of the glass. The big, round palate offers dried black cherry, blackberry jam, licorice and chopped herb alongside ripe, loosely knit tannins. It's straightforward for a Brunello but it has a juicy, immediate appeal. Drink now through 2020.
