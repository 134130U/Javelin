This wine may have potential in the years to come, but is still searching for its soul at this young age. Aromas of dried black cherries and strawberries meet with black tea, juniper and a touch of tar on the nose. The palate is framed in a foamy acidity, offering plum and squeezed blackberry fruit, but dominated with a very herbal character that's still integrating.
