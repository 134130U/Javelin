Made from a blend of Nero d'Avola, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, the 35th anniversary edition of this iconic wine opens with aromas of earth, leather, black currant and bell pepper. Black cherry, chocolate, cocoa and black pepper all weave together seamlessly on the elegant palate, alongside silky tannins.
