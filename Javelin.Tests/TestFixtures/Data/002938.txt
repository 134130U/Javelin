Call this Zin lusty, huge, gigantic, massive, anything that describes scale. Some Zins like this are over the top, but this one maintains a precarious balance, despite high alcohol and superripe raisin and dark chocolate flavors. With firm tannins, it's classic Monte Rosso Zinfandel, and will age for decades.
