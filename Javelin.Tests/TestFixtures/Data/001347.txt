The grapes for this wine from regional pioneer Gary Eberle are nearly equally sourced from three vineyards: Steinbeck, Wine-Bush and CoCaVin. The nose is herbal with sagebrush, oregano and thyme, offering just a bit of black plum fruit. The palate is also full of crushed, dried herbs, proving a touch sour and tarry, with cooked strawberry and dried raspberry fruit.
