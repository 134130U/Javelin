Even by past standards, this new vintage of Sineann's Old Vine Zin is spectacular, with ripe, jammy, concentrated fruit flavors of fig, black cherry and purple plum. The balance among the fruit, acidity, tannin and alcohol is spot-on, without blowing away the more subtle compexity of the old vine fruit.
