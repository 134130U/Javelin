This is the second vintage of sparkling wine production for winemaker Blair Fox but the first he's controlled from start to finish, and the early results are exciting. Zesty lime, graphite and raspberry scents lead the nose, while red plum, pomegranate and citrus flavors converge. It's full and foamy on the palate.
