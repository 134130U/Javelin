This reserve-level cuv√©e spent eight months in 55% new French oak, and can benefit from additional bottle age. Tightly wound flavors of red berries and red licorice carry a hint of watery chocolate. But there isn't the expected depth or power here, given its place in the winery's Pinot Noir hierarchy.
