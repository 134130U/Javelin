For this medium-sweet wine, the Grassa family has chosen one of the Southwest's great grape varieties. The Gros Manseng easily makes this style: fruity and with a fine balance between sweetness and crisp acidity. This is a young wine, named after the singing thrush (grive) in the vines. It's still developing and will be better from 2018.
