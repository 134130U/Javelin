Made from head-trained vines planted where California winemaking pioneer Agoston Haraszthy first grew the variety 150 years ago, this lush wine offers intense aromatics of tar, brick and smoke, with briary blackberry secondary on the nose. The finish is topped by flavors of cocoa and a sprinkling of black pepper.
