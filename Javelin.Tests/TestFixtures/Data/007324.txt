Appealing modern-leaning aromas of root beer, berry fruits and vanilla settle with airing and turn more mellow and traditional for Rioja. Slightly plush on the palate, especially given 2013's cool nature, this is balanced despite showing raw tannins. Toasty blackened flavors of baked berry fruits, chocolate and licorice finish long, toasty and peppery. Drink through 2025â€“2028.
