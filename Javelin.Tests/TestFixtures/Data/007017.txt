Notable oaky aromas like cedar and clove join bold fruit and spice flavors in this medium-bodied, stylized wine from a classic producer. This bottling seems less overtly ripe and more spicy in style than recent vintages. On the palate, it oozes clove, tamarind, cardamom and black-cherry flavors. Best after 2019.
