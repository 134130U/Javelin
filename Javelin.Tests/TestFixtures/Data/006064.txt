The nose is shy but subtly hints at citrus zest. The palate comes alive with subtle, fresh and very pure fruit: exquisitely accurate notions of mirabelle plum and beautifully aromatic tangerine. This is pure, streamlined and richly fruited, but done in a subtle grown-up way. A real joy to savor and drink. Finishes dry.
