This wine is sourced from a handful of stellar vineyards, including Pratt, Dutton, Sullivan and Chenoweth. It was given 18 months in French oak, all of it twice-used or older, which contributes to an integrated, understated wood presence that's refreshing in its restraint. Creamy acidity and a taste of baked bread cradles lemon zest and almond before a crisp, lengthy finish.
