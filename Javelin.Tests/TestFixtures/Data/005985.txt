Louisa Lindquist produces this almost Pinot Noir-like Tempranillo from her cool climate site in the southern Edna Valley. It leads with red cherry and rust scents and shows more red cherry, iron and baking spice flavors on the palate, leaving a delicate and refreshing impression laced with rocky minerality.
