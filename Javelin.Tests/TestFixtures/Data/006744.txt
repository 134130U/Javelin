A gentle lift of crushed black cherry rises from the glass. There also is an edge of medicinal herb. The body is light and juicy, fresh and highly aromatic. There is concentration without weight, luxuriant fruit without plumpness. This is fresh and pure, lifted and profound. An utterly honest and uplifting rendition of Pinot Noir.
