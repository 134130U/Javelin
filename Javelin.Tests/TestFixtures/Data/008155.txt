Situated on limestone and clay (peyredoulle means hard rock in an old dialect), the wine offers spice and sweet fruit flavors, balancing wood and fruitiness. The classic Merlot, Malbec, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot blend has considerable potential, allowing plenty of room for the fruit and the wood tannin flavors to integrate. Drink from 2017.
