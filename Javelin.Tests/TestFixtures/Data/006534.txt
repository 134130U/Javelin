Pascal Savoret is the only producer with vines actually in the village (as distinct from the appellation) of Madiran, a mere population of 430. He has produced a dense and tannic wine, packed with woody dark tannins. The black fruits and concentrated dusty texture promise further aging for this Tannat wine. Drink from 2020.
