Solidly structured, this wine is medium- to full-bodied, moderately tannic and heading toward maturity in flavors. The medium garnet color goes to tawny at the rim. Aromas of cola, cherries and a touch of smoke are followed by rather lean fruit and clove flavors. Unfined, unfiltered and fermented with wild yeast.
