Creamy wild cherry, crushed strawberry, exotic incense, clove and cinnamon-spice spill from the glass when you pour this delicious wine made on the slopes of Mount Etna. It's very youthful, with fresh red-berry fruit and bright acidity balanced by polished tannins. A licorice notes signals the close.
