This delicious blend of Syrah, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot opens with aromas of ripe black fruit, berries, tilled soil, blue flower and spice. The concentrated palate delivers fleshy black cherry, red currants, black pepper and graphite alongside smooth tannins. The long finish closes on a licorice note.
