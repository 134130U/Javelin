Peach blossom, Spanish broom, white flower and mineral aromas create a lovely bouquet. Made entirely with Chardonnay, the savory, creamy palate offers yellow apple, mature pear, nectarine, pastry and mineral alongside fresh acidity. Endowed with depth and balance, this will continue to develop over the next several years. Drink 2015â€“2020.
