Richness and rusticity ride side by side in this Pinot Noir. It has enormously ripe raspberry, cherry and persimmon flavors, with a balanced jacket of oak and crisp acidity. On the other hand, the tannins are edgy, giving the wine a jagged feeling. The wine will age for many years, without gaining complexity.
