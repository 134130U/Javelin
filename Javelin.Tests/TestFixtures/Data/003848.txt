Hand-sorting and 18 months of aging is the key here. This 80% Merlot blend with 15% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cabernet Franc offers a generously proportioned balance of tannins and black fruits. It has full-bodied character, packed with berry fruits and rich acidity. With all these elements, it will develop well. Drink from 2017.
