Funky earth tones of forest floor, brown button mushrooms and aged beef rise as leading scents in this Rh√¥ne-style blend. The nicely rounded, velvety palate, which emerges steadily over the course of a sip, offers plum flavors and soft but present tannins, representing a wine that could last a few more years.
