Aromas of rose petal, perfumed berry and exotic spice lead the nose. It's radiant, with wonderful intensity and elegance, delivering ripe red cherry, raspberry compote, mineral, licorice, baking spice and a hint of mint alongside a backbone of firm, fine-grained tannins and edgy acidity. Despite the full structure and youthful tension, it has a remarkably silky, supple texture. Drink 2018â€“2032.
