This is one of the vintage's knockout ros√©s, thanks in part to the Grenache and Gamay grapes that make up the blend. It's pale pink in color, with supple lime pith, strawberry, chalk and melon aromas. The palate is tense with structure, its bubblegum and lemon peel flavors riding a wave of acidity that persists long into the finish.
