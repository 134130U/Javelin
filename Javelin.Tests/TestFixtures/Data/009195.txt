Opaquely purple in color, this Syrah-Mourv√®dre blend (with 1% Viognier that co-fermented with the Syrah) boasts a brooding black cherry, pipe tobacco and tarragon nose. Then it delivers a much more nuanced palate, with very ripe blackberry, oaky vanilla and a tartness on the backend. It's well integrated, with some tannins to make it last. Drink now with a porterhouse steak, or hold until 2020 and track the sure-to-be-exciting evolution.
