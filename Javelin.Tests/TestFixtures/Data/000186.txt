This is a lush and powerful wine from a vineyard in the recently designated Paso Highlands district. Aromas suggest gingerbread topped with kirsch-soaked, chocolate-covered cherries. The palate is thick and heavy, with mocha, stewed plums, mashed cherries and black earth, which gain complexity from tannins and pencil lead.
