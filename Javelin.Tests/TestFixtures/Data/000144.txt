Clean, sharp and zesty fruit blossom aromas meet with ripe pomelo and green apple scents on the nose of this wine by Steve Dooley. A fresh, tingling acidity shows on the sip, which is a tad sour with stone fruit skins but bountiful in a slate-driven minerality and grippy texture. Cool climate Albari√±o has much promise in the state.
