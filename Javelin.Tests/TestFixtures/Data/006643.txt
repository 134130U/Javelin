Dark violet-red in color, this is a blend of 40% Petite Sirah, 35% Petit Verdot and 25% Shiraz. A bouquet of cherry, violet and mesquite lay the groundwork for a winning mélange of savory fruit flavors—think cherry, strawberry, smoke, flint, jasmine and orange peel. Smooth tannins lead the way to an orange-rind finish, with a hint of smoke and a slight umami feeling on the palate.
