Don't be fooled by the pale, almost white, color. This is a spicy herbal wine that comes from a selection of the estate's best vineyards. It has a fine cut of acidity to keep it crisp. It is juicy and packed with fruit, immediately attractive. The aftertaste with its zesty tang is refreshing. Drink now.
