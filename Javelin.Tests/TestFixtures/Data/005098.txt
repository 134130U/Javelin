This opens with inviting, classic Sangiovese aromas: woodland berry, forest floor, new leather, violet and truffle. The youthfully taut palate isn't quite as expressive—yet—but already offers Marasca cherry, white pepper and star anise notes. It's primary in its flavors now but will develop complexity over the next decade and then maintain well for years. Drink 2022–2032.
