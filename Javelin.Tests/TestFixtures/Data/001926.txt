Some ageable Cabs are lovely to drink on release. Not this one. It's tough in tannins, with a gum-stinging astringency. Below all that are ripe, concentrated blackberry jam and cassis flavors. Blended with Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, it's already throwing some sediment, a good sign, which means you won't have to wait 20 years for it to come around. Pop that cork after 2018.
