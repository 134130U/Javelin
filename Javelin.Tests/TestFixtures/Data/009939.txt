Tart cherry, baking spice and dried chaparral show on the nose of this appellation blend from pioneering vintner Richard Sanford and Nick de Luca, making for a soft and easy entry. It's light and refreshing on the palate, with a bit of tannic depth, offering dried cranberry, juniper and garrigue-inflected flavors. Lively and vibrant with herbal depth.
