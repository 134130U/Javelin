Old Zinfandel plant material from Santa Cruz was propagated in one of the most inhospitable sites for grapes on Catalina Island to make this wineâ€”a fascinating story for any history lover. The wine itself is somewhat simple, with generic red fruit, turned loam and black pepper scents, followed by cranberry, white pepper and crushed rock flavors on the palate.
