Raspberry jam, prune, cake spice and grilled herb aromas unfold on this full-bodied wine. The palate is already rather evolved, offering dried black cherry, fig, anise and tobacco alongside mature tannins that lead to a tongue-drying finish. Drink sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit.
