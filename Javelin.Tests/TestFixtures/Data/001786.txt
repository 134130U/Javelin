Waves of purple floral fragrance meld with soy, blackberry and roast lamb on the nose of this complex and compelling bottling. It's quite soft on the palate, with black plum and hoisin sauce flavors accenting its core of dried purple fruit, black pepper and bacon fat. The finish offers a touch of maple syrup.
