Made from grapes grown in one of the best vineyards in the valley, this Syrah is a particular success, given the challenging vintage. It's tannic, bone dry and zesty in acidity, with deeply extracted blackberry, black currant, charred meat bone and black pepper flavors. The long, rich finish suggests aging. Hold until 2017.
