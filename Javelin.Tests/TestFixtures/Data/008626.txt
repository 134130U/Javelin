Dark ruby in the glass, this wine has a bouquet of black cherry, jalapeño and celery root that continually invites you back for another sniff. There is a terrific balance between fruit and savory flavors, which include black currant, cherry, white chocolate, mint and jalapeño. Smooth tannins go on and on until they are finally punctuated by a bright cranberry note.
