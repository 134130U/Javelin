A beautiful black currant character animates this classically-styled wine. It's fruity and generously spiced on the nose, with cinnamon and nutmeg scents from oak. Its flavors build on that black currant, with spice notes giving it a layered effect, supported by fine-grained tannins. While irrestible now, this will be best after 2019.
