Dusty cherry, wild berry and minerally aromas comprise a compact, deep nose that's entirely inviting. Juicy, bold and bright on the palate, with sturdy tannins, this offers exotic notes of cumin and baking spices along with wild berry flavors. It's elegant, complete and thorough on the finish; drink through 2020.
