This wine is tasty, tangy and nervy, bringing a very refreshing and appetizing mouthfeel, and wonderful fresh acidity. All of that tang shows good fruitiness too, as the red-cherry and cranberry flavors are vivid and concentrated. It's a versatile wine to drink now or buy by the case to save some bottles for more aging.
