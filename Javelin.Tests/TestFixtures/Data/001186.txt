This blend of 35% Chardonnay, 35% Pinot Blanc and 30% Pinot Gris from La Encantada Vineyard is a stunner, starting with its crystalline brilliance in the glass. Lime blossom, pomelo, baking soda and lanolin aromas lead into a grippy palate of green apple, chalk and wet cement. Extremely tense and compelling.
