Part of a rare library release, this 26-year-old bottling provides a dramatic showcase of how sweeter styles of Riesling transform with age. It's still aromatic of honey and marmalade, yet the on the palate, the sweetness is barely perceivable. It's ethereal in body, with just a gauzy lace of sugar sprinkled over layers of mineral and spice.
