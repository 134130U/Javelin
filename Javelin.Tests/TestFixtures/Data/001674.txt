A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese, Merlot and Syrah, this opens with aromas of black currant, pencil shavings, toast and a whiff of pine. Notes of mocha, graphite and anise add depth to the black cherry core alongside chewy but astringent tannins that leave a drying finish. Drink 2016â€“2018.
