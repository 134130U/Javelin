Aromas of almond skins, pyrazines and spent white fruits struggle to draw you in. This vintage was wet and cool in Galicia, with frost issues, and this shows it. The palate is round but oily in feel, while flavors of saline water, pithy citrus and bitter melon finish peppery and soft, with low acidity.
