Credited as the first wine made solely with noble native grape Nero d'Avola, this iconic bottling opens with aromas that recall ripe berry, lightly toasted oak, leather and cooking spice. The firm, structured palate delivers ripe blackberry, juicy wild cherry, licorice, tobacco and savory herb alongside velvety tannins. It's already tempting but will continue to develop complexity. Drink 2015â€“2024.
