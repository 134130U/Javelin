Aromas of cola nut, bacon, blackberry, licorice and wood smoke announce a raw rugged palate that's not nearly as plump and lush as it normally is: a clear reflection of the cool 2013 vintage in Rioja. Dry peppery black-fruit flavors finish with toasty oak and licorice notes. Although rough and rugged now, this should improve little by little through about 2030.
