This is the second wine of Larrivet Haut-Brion. It is rich with tannins and juicy with black-currant acidity. As befits a second wine, it is developing well and easily. Drink from 2021. While it shares the same name as Ch√¢teau Haut-Brion, there is no ownership or location connection between the two properties.
