Fragrant blue flower, red berry and balsamic notes set the tone for this delicious red. The elegantly structured palate delivers wild cherry, crushed raspberry and chopped mint flavors, a potpourri of dark spice lingering through the finish. It's enjoyable now but promises fine drinking over the next several years. Drink through 2022.
