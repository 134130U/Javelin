Planted in 2006 to heirloom clones, most of them Pommard, this is a concentrated, tannic wine that needs time in bottle to develop. For now, expect rose and raspberry, with a depth of black cherry compoteâ€”flavors that are immediately inviting and richly layered. Yet, it will tell more of its story down the road. Allow it to open now or cellar through 2029.
