To me, this luxury cuv√©e loses a bit of its identity to oak and ripeness while remaining an excellent red wine. Delicious? You bet. It's dark and intense, marked by the vanilla and cedar notes that overlay cherry and cracked pepper. The tannins are supple to the point of creaminess, creating a lush, soft mouthfeel.
