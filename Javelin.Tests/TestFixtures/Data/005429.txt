Named after a term for beautiful gesture, this wine is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon with small amounts the other primary Bordeaux varieties blended in. Aromas of dark cherry, black tea, pencil lead and vanilla are followed by well-constructed smoke and dark fruit flavors with grainy, compact tannins that need some time to stretch their legs.
