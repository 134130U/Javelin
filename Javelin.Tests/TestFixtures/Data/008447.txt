Those who love the smell of campfires could park their nose in this wine all day. But this is gourmet smoke, reminiscent of applewood, with hints of vanilla and tea-smoked duck. On the palate, this extremely well-put-together wine is plush, expansive and tastes like blueberry pie, adorned with the buttery crust and all.
