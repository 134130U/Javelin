Black currant, cherry, plum and floral aromas form a nose with freshness as well as power. Lively, layered and fruity on the palate, this single-vineyard Malbec is lightly herbal and toasty, with wild berry flavors leading the charge. A tight, firm finish with raspberry and red-currant flavors ensures that this will stand the test of time. Best 2016â€“2022.
