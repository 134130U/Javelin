Full bodied, creamy and rich, this wine will undoubtedly please Torbreck fans and provide another piece of ammo for critics. Tasted blind, I wrote, “Torbreck-like nose of lifted spice and stewed berries.” There's a hint of mint as well. Mixed berries and brown sugar notes mingle easily on the palate, while a touch of dried fruit (not a positive) creeps in on the finish. Drink now–2025.
