Made from 68-year-old Nerello Mascalese vines and aged in terra-cotta amphorae, this ripe and powerful wine offers aromas of leather, tilled earth, game, truffle and black berry fruit. The juicy palate delivers mouthfuls of black cherry accented with clove and cinnamon alongside round, velvety tannins and the warmth of alcohol.
