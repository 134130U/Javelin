Winemaker Mark McNeilly from Mark Ryan Winery makes this estate grown Viognier, and works it in the same strong, substantial, concentrated style as his own release. The mix of concrete and neutral oak fermentation brings out some nice floral highlights and a light hint of toast. The length and flavor development through the long finish are exceptional.
