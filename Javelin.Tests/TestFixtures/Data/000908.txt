This lightly wood-aged wine, from an estate that has only changed hands three times in 400 years, is crisp, tight and very young. It has fine potential for the future. There are elegant fruits, spice and intense acidity that needs to soften. Produced from selected high-altitude parcels, the wine is balanced between the tangy texture and mineral fruitiness. Drink from early 2018.
