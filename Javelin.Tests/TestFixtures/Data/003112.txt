This deep and hearty blend of 35% Petit Verdot, 30% Merlot, 29% Petite Sirah and 6% Syrah shows ripe blueberry, loamy soil, violet and milk chocolate notes on the lavish nose. It's thick on the palate, with ever-present and evenly dispersed tannins that drive caramelized black currant, cocoa and charred coffee flavors into the finish.
