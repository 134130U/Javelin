This dark-colored, extracted Priorat smells largely of oak and mint on top of lightly herbal, green-leaning plum and currant. The palate is wiry, with citric acidity that creates tartness to go with monotone red-fruit flavors. Rough, tough and crisp on the finish, with tomatoey acidity and hard tannins.
