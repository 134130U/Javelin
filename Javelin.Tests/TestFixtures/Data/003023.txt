Dark strawberries, rose buds, black plums, sweet cedar, tangy herbs and oodles of dark fruit pour off the nose of this wine, which is leveled by 13% Syrah. Bursting acidity frames the palate alongside red currants, peppercorns, dill and black olive. It's slightly less dense in style than other Mourv√®dres.
