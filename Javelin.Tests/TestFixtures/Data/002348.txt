This bottling, which is both a reference to the Lynyrd Skynyrd song and an ode to the grape growers, offers vibrant blackberry, slate and vanilla aromas. The palate is ripe and juicy but balanced, with tangy plum skin and dark spice flavors, framed by a chalky tannic structure. It's fruity enough for traditional California Zinfandel fans but complex enough to win converts.
