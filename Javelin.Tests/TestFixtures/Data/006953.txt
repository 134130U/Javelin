Pfersigberg, the hill of peach trees, is an apt name for this ripe wine. Yellow and tropical fruits show strongly along with spice, bergamot and concentration from the 50-year-old vines in the wine. The chalk soil gives a touch of minerality to the aftertaste that remains rich and full-bodied in style. Drink from 2017.
