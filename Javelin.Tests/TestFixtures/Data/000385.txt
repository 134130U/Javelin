Aromas of mulled black fruits, vanilla, tobacco, orange peel and earth are a touch jumbled, but compartmentalizedâ€”this smells nice. Wiry and fresh in feel, but with a slightly hollow midsection, this tastes peppery, oaky and like cherry and black plum. A toasty finish with snappy acidity solidifies this medium-weight La Mancha Tempranillo. Drink through 2019.
