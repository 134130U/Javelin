Made entirely of the Alpine grape Pri√© Blanc, planted in the highest vineyards in Europe, this vibrant sparkler opens with aromas of green apple, white spring flowers and a hint of resin. The palate offers ripe Bartlett pear, creamy Granny Smith and Alpine herb alongside brisk acidity and persistent bubbles.
