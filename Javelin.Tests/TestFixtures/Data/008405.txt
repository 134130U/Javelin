The name Tradition in Loire terms often means no wood aging. This wine is certainly all fruit: 75% Gamay and 25% Pinot Noir, from the small area of Chateaumeillant south of Sancerre. The grapes give a juicy, red cherry and berry-flavored wine that's fresh and light. After nearly four years, it is ready to drink.
