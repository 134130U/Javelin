Here's a blend of 25% Sangiovese, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 25% Syrah that opens with aromas of red currant, bell pepper and roasted coffee beans. The medium-bodied, one-dimensional palate offers dried black cherry, black pepper, espresso and a gamy note alongside moderate tannins. Drink through 2016.
