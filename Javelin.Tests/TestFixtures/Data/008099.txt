For this sweet and jammy wine, the fruit is sourced from what is reputed to be the second-oldest planting of Syrah in Washington State. Hints of lilac lead into concentrated flavors of blueberry and boysenberry, along with lush barrel accents of mocha and chocolate. Tannins are smooth and silky, and the wine has the grip and substance to cellar well through at least 2024.
