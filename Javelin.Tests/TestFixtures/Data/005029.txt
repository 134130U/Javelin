Protected by the Massif de Sainte-Baume, kept dry and sunny with the Mistral winds that blow down the Rh√¥ne Valley, this vineyard can produce ripe wines like this. It has a crisp cool feel to it, bright with acidity as well as red currant and tangy orange. This is a delicious wine, with a fruity aftertaste.
