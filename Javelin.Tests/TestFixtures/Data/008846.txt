Composed and elegant on the nose, this classic Priorat blend of Grenache and Carignan opens with minerally berry aromas and a touch of fine oak. The palate is tight, intense and well etched, with dark, toasty flavors of schisty black fruits. Licorice flavors and herbal notes guide the finish on this excellent Spanish red. Drink through 2019.
