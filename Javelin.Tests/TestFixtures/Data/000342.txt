Aromas of perfumed berry, mint, baking spice and a whiff of oak emerge on this structured wine. The firm palate offers wild red cherry, crushed raspberry, mint, grilled sage and a touch of oak-driven spice alongside bracing tannins and nervous acidity. Give it time to soften and fully develop. Drink 2019â€“2031.
