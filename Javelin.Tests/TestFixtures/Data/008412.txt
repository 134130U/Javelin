Blended from selected vineyards across the Sonoma Coast near Carneros, including the producer's own estate, this wine is made to be approachable and ready to go. It was aged in neutral oak casks, stainless steel and some larger neutral French oak. Herb and mint stand out against a backdrop of rustic black cherry.
