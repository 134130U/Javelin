Subdued aromas of black currant, chocolate and a whiff cedar lead the nose of this blend of 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Cabernet Franc, 30% Merlot and 10% Petit Verdot. On the palate, notes of grilled bell pepper, soy sauce and game accent a core of dried black cherry. It's simple and a bit rustic, with dusty, drying tannins.
