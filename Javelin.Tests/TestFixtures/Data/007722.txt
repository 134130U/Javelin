Aromas of cedary oak, vanilla and spiced berry fruits are encouraging. In the mouth, however, this old-vines Malbec is jumpy and rubbery, with high acidity. Flavors of stalky red plum taste mildly oxidized and Sherried, while the finish is herbal and tastes burnt. All in all, this just doesn't fully come together.
