The grapes for this full-bodied wine hail from the Luvisi Vineyard in the heart of Calistoga old-vine countryâ€”a warm and welcome site for the variety. Baked blackberry and black olive combine around a taste of charred meat before brawny spins of brown sugar and nutmeg play on the palate with jolts of chocolate and vanilla.
