Rich aromas of juicy peach and Damask rose have the lovely and tempering edge of grapefruit zest. The palate gives us the same welcomed counterpoint of zesty aromatic freshness and perfumed opulence. This has lovely fluid freshness, couched in sumptuous flavors. This is exquisitely balanced and finishes just about still dry.
