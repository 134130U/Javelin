Pinot Noir specialist Bryan Babcock explores this aromatic white grape, delivering a lush and creamy expression. Poached pear and orange blossom notes combine with a nutty quality on the nose, while the wine's creamy consistency meets buoyant acidity on the palate. Lush apple, pear and cashews flavors complete the picture.
