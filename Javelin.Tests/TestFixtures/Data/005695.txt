New leather, sun-baked earth, blue flower and gamy hints of cured meat are some of the aromas you'll find in this structured red. The bright, taut palate offers sour cherry, crushed raspberry, pipe tobacco and grilled herb flavors, while youthfully firm tannins provide support. It's chock-full of character but may need a few more years to unwind. Drink 2020â€“2032.
