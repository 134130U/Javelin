Deep purple fruit aromas of dried blackberries and pressed plums benefit from a fresh dill edge as well as a umami element on the nose of this wine from the Rice family, which started making wine in 1990. The acidity and alcohol combine for a tongue-tantalizing sip, with flavors of black cherries and dark herbs.
