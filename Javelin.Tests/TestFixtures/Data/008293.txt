Roughly one-third of the blend is Jacob-Hart vineyard fruit. The wine spent a year in one-third new French oak, and retains a fresh, youthful splash of primary cherry and black currant fruit. Supple and well-integrated, it leads into a finish lush with dusty coffee, cocoa, smoke and toasted marshmallow.
