Brilliant golden color promises richness. The nose obliges with a seamless scent of apples: fresh and ripe, baked and mellow. The palate shows soaring freshness, but countless notions swirl on the dry palate of this traditional field blend: citrus and apple, pear and blossom. There is so much fruit, so much expression, this is pure exuberance, but in a rather grown-up way. A very apt expression of both the freshness and the richness of Alsace.
