The inviting aromas of campfire smoke dominate the aromas of this wine, but there are also pressed red cherry, berry reduction sauce and roasted venison elements on the nose. The palate picks up morel mushrooms, mulberry, cranberry, smoked meats, ponzu sauce, black pepper and a bit of sour fruit, proving to be a very solid sipper.
