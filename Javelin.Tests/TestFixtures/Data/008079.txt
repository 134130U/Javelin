From the cool east face of the vineyard, this is crisp and tight, less opulent than some Corton-Charlemagne. It makes up in its rich structure, weight and tropical fruit flavors that are sliced by acidity. There is some kerosene along with these exotic fruits, and the wine does need to age. Drink from 2018.
