Kirsten's 2014 Rieslings each share a core of minerality that prevails over primary fruit, but this dry bottling is particularly savory in style. It's refreshingly spry with layers of smoke and chalk notes meandering amidst sheer streaks of fresh, white grapefruit and apple. The finish is brisk and clean.
