Many are now playing with the low-alcohol, nervy side of Chardonnay, but Doug Margerum succeeds more than most. This bottling is light in the glass, with clean and crisp Asian pear, nectarine and mandarin pith aromas. The palate is tightly wound and energetic, showing sharp citrus and rounded strone-fruit flavors. Drink nowâ€“2030.
