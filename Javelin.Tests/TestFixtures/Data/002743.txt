There is something heady about this: a hint of chamomile tincture and pure lemon zest. The palate cuts in with uncompromising purity and zestiness—this really wants to showcase pure stone and tart citrus. There are glimpses, however, of plump ripe mirabelle plums and a touch of dried pear and quince. Nonetheless, this is governed by stern tanginess and thus is for real adults only. This is dry, slender and shows absolute focus. A celebration of stone and Riesling. Don't drink this now but wait: Drink 2020–2035.
