This marks the debut of the Ramos Vineyard Chardonnay, inspired by a high-elevation site planted in 2001 by the late Bob Sessions and Jose Ramos, now director of vineyard operations. The wine paints a portrait of high-toned, elegant minerality accented by peach and lithe lemon. Capable of aging, it dances in acidity, with just a hint of caramel-vanilla on the finish. Made in tiny quantities, it's worth desperately seeking out.
