Saitone is a supremely historic vineyard, planted originally in 1895 in the thick of the Russian River Valley's Olivet Bench, a coveted spot these days for Pinot Noir. The wine offers supple, soft tannins around a juicy intensity of grenadine and berry crumble. The structured backbone of minerality is remarkable.
