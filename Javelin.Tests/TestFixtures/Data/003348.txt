Smoked beef and pork aromas with hints of flint, licorice and black currant show on the nose of this 45% Syrah, 43% Cabernet Sauvignon and 12% Petit Verdot blend. The palate is soft upon entry, growing sticky with robust tannins as it opens, and offering black peppercorn, teriyaki and lavish black cherry flavors. Drink 2019â€“2033.
