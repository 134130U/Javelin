Dark shades of bramble and smoked nuts lend a shadowy mystique to this unusual Schwartzriesling, otherwise known as Pinot Meunier. Full bodied yet elegant, the palate boasts tart blackberry and raspberry flavors framed in finely grained tannins. A rare chance to experience this grape as a single varietal wine.
