Slightly shy aromas of blackberry, black plum and turned black soil are simple and straightforward on this wine. The palate combines pencil lead with anise, thyme, marjoram and black pepper, framed by tart cranberry, beet juice and sour-cherry fruit. A sip enlivens the mouth and wipes clean on the finish.
