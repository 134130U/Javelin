Stony peach and mandarin orange aromas are touched up by a note of white licorice gumdrop on this well-cut, finesse-filled Albari√±o. In the mouth, an elegant dance ensues between minerality, lees notes and citric acidity. Flavors of apricot, peach and melon finish minerally and with a slow but steady fade. Drink through 2016.
