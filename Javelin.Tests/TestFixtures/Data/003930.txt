Ponzi is promoting a multi-clone winemaking approach they label “Clonal Massale.” This single vineyard example co-ferments five Dijon and 22 heritage clones of Pinot Noir—the most extensive in the country, according to the winery. Dark and lengthy, it's a sexy, complex yet subtle wine, with blackberry and black cherry fruit, a touch of soy and ample Asian spices.
