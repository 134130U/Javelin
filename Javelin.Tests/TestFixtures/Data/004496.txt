The nose is a very enticing mix of rose petal and peach, grapefruit zest and musky spice. The palate echoes the same flavors and is both intense and concentrated. There is residual sweetness making all the fruit flavors luscious and plump, countered by sprightly fresh acidity that results in an over all medium-sweet wine. The flavors are precise and clean and so is the finish.
