This bottling slips in many corners of the flavor experience at once. On the nose, a bit of tropical fruit mixes with evenly spread buttercream, followed by precursor hints of bright acidity on the palate. That citrus-led vibrancy does come, as does a mix of creaminess and limestone-inflected tang, as if the rocks themselves delivered the acidity.
