Translucent red in color, this coastal Pinot is light and peppery on the nose, with saline and celery stalk scents along with baked plum and raspberry notes. Oak aging has left a buttery texture that's cut by acidity, while flavors of cherry and plum are supported by barrel notes and acid-based juiciness.
