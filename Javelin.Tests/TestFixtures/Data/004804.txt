This big and ripe wine hardly tastes like Bordeaux. That is until you get beneath the rich fruit and find the firmer tannins and the juicy black currant from Cabernet Sauvignon. The wine is certainly powerful with its dense texture and juicy, jammy feel. It could still age, but not for long. Drink from 2015.
