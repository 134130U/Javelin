Earthy, almost funky aromas recall farmyard and overripe black fruit, with whiffs of leather and menthol. The palate offers fleshy black cherry, licorice and coffee, sweetened with sugary vanilla notes alongside bracing tannins. It's a bit muddled right now but it may improve with more bottle age. Drink after 2016.
