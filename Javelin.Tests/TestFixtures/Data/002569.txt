Char and roasted coffee notes lend a brooding, smoky backdrop to bright red berry and cherry flavors in this full-bodied Pinot Noir. Cranberry acidity bristles the palate, leading a long finish marked by firm but fine tannins. It needs another 3â€“5 years in the cellar to integrate, but should mature elegantly.
