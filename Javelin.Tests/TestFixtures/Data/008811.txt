In 2014 this vineyard designate was further subdivided by clone. The Pommard bottling pushes big fruit front and centerâ€”a juicy mix of blood orange, red berries and cherries. There's a certain stiffness to the tannins still, but overall it's finely proportioned and should be enjoyable through the mid-2020s.
