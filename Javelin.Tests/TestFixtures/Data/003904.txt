The Cabernet Sauvignon grape really comes through on this ros√© from Paso Robles pioneer Justin. There is strawberry shortcake at first, but the Cab's capacin-led aromas of green bell pepper are prominent. The pepper carries through to the palate, in a very intriguing, tasty way, offering balance between berry fruit and green bitterness.
