This blend of 45% Grenache, 30% Mourv√®dre and 25% Syrah from Bob and Lynn Tillman's Adelaida Road estate offers an intriguing, aromatic mix of sanguine blood elements alongside ripe black cherries and white pepper. Solid acidity and good tannins frame the palate, which delivers espresso, elderberry, licorice and forest-floor flavors.
