The wine comes from a single, high-elevation vineyard owned by Château Lagrézette. Wood aged, it smooths out the naturally creamy Viognier to give a broad generous wine. Spice and apricot fruits are balanced by green-fruit acidity. The opulent wine is just about ready to drink although it will be better from 2018.
