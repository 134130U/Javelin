A hearty swirl in the glass wakes up this wine's aroma, showing lemon balm, cress and green pear. Those fresh flavors also play on the lithe palate, where yeasty savoriness is enhanced by lemony spritz. It's totally zippy and refreshing, with far more concentration than is at first apparent, proving it needs time to breathe.
