A savory blend of 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 45% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc, this opens with aromas of scorched earth, meat juices, leather, black fruit and spices. The dense, low-acid palate delivers black currants and fleshy black cherry accented with black pepper and mocha alongside soft, round tannins. Drink now through 2017.
