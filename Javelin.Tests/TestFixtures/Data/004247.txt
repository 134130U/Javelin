A slightly brooding nose suggests brambly fruit as well as freshness. The palate crunches with red and black cherry, imbued with a kind of boyish impish joy. This is disarmingly rustic, but also very, very unusual and utterly moreish in its singular and honest simplicity. Drying tannins coat the mouth while juicy tart freshness makes you want to take another sip. This is all about stormy, romantic wilderness. Beware, this might just steal your heart.
