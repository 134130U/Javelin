A whiff of wet stone joins varietal aromas of cut grass, tomato vine and tropical fruit in this round, fragrant white. The fresh, full-flavored palate offers pineapple, juicy grapefruit and honeydew melon notes cut with citrus. Tangy acidity adds brightness while an energizing mineral note lifts the finish.
