This blend of 68% Sangiovese, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 12% Merlot hits the nose with aromas of brick, uncrushed clove, red cherries, wet gravel, rosewater and a touch of tobacco. The palate is surprisingly light, but packs cedar, pipesmoke, clove and nutmeg against a red cherry and cranberry backdrop.
