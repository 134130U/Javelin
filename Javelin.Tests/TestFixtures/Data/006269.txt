This luxurious and well-mannered wine was aged in a new but un-toasted French cask. Solid structure supports its ample fruit flavors and full body, lending balance. Bright acidity and moderate tannins add texture on the palate, framing its ripe black cherry, blueberry and dark chocolate flavors nicely.
