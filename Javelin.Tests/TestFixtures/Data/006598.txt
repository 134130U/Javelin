This blend of 70% Sangiovese, 10% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Franc and 10% Petit Verdot offers faint aromas of menthol, underbrush and a whiff of blue flowers. The menthol note carries over to the palate, along with a hint of anise, but the fruit is completely dried up, leaving an abrupt, astringent finish.
