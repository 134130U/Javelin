This blend of Syrah, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon offers up decadent juicy flavors of sun-kissed red cherries and watermelon. While dry in style, there's a slightly caramelized ripeness on the midpalate that balances out pertly against brisk grapefruit acidity. Enjoy now for its forward fruity exuberance.
