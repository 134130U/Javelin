A meaty Cab with small percentages of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Sirah, this was given two years in mostly French oak. Pencil shavings and tar dominate on the nose, opening the way for a juiciness on the palate expressing dried herb and cassis. Integrated, the finish is savory and oaky. Enjoy through 2021.
