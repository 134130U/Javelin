A blend of Sangiovese and Syrah, this opens with aromas of toasted oak, roasted coffee beans, wood-driven spice and a whiff of barnyard. The palate shows dried black fruit, black pepper and a gamy note. The bracing tannins are still tightly wound but it's shy on freshness and fruit richness so drink sooner rather than later.
