This blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Merlot, 19% Cab Franc and 10% Petit Verdot is sourced from the Hedges, Stillwater, and Conner Lee vineyards. At first soft and smooth, it morphs into a textural wine with a mouthful of purple and black fruitsâ€”from blackberry on through cassis. Streaks of smoke, graphite and espresso highlight the finish.
