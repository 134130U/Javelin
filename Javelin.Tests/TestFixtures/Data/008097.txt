This almost-pure Cabernet includes grapes sourced from Red Mountain and Horse Heaven Hills vineyards. The structure is gorgeous—massive yet precise—with a steely spine, great concentration and supple, mixed black fruits. A streak of lead pencil and a hint of toast contribute further complexity. Delicious already, this will reward cellaring through 2025.
