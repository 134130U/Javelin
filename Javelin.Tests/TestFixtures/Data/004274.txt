This hearty red opens with aromas of toast, coffee bean, ripe plum, leather and a dash of menthol. The warm, robust palate offers dried black cherry marinated in spirits, raisin, licorice and espresso alongside dusty tannins that dry out the finish. Showing the heat of the vintage, it's already evolved, with evident alcohol that throws it off-balance.
