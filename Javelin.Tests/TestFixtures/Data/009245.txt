Made mostly with Nero d'Avola and Syrah, this structured but elegant wine offers aromas of dried black fruit, underbrush, crushed blue flower and a suggestion of baking spice. The firm, smooth palate delivers black cherry, blackberry, ground pepper, cinnamon, licorice and tobacco alongside velvety tannins.
