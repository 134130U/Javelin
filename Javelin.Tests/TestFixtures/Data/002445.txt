Somehow, in a stellar 2014 lineup, this vineyard designate stands out, as the 2012 did when it was the Wine Enthusiast 2015 wine of the year. Power and precision work in tandem here. The fruit blend conjures up melon, berry, cherry and more, and the oak has the gentlest touch to its presence. There's tremendous midpalate concentration, and the clear sense that this could age for decades. Let's just say drink 2018 through 2030.
