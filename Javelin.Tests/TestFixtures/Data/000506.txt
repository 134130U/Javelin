Look for the blue bottle and you'll get a solid Albari√±o. This is typically light and fresh, with aromas of stream water, wild flowers, fresh herbs and leesy stone fruits. Crisp and citric on the palate, with proper cut, this tastes of orange, peach, nectarine and lemon. Minerally, cleansing and steady on the finish.
