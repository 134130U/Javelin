Close to half Viognier, this is cofermented with Roussanne and Marsanne, then blended with 7% Grenache Blanc. A small portion of the Viognier was fermented in Acacia oak. Deep and rich flavors are packed with sliced pear, then range on through oranges and mixed citrus, adding a touch of vanilla in a fresh tangy lingering finish.
