This wine suggests green, savory herbs along with cherry and currant. It's elegant in style, velvety in feel, and delivers good concentration to the fruit flavors plus barrel notes (20% new French) on the lingering finish. The variety gets lost with the herbal notes taking over, but it still offers enjoyment.
