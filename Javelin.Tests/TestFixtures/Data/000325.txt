This is an impressively rich, still very young wine. Dominated by Bandol's own Mourv√®dre grape, it is dense and concentrated. Spice and dark red fruits are shot through with a wonderful herbal character that conjures the southern warmth. The wine is still just setting out and will not be ready to drink before 2019.
