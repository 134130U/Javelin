Old Wente clones drive the richness of this wine, a mix of lemon, oak and fennel, with a touch of spice on the finish. A waft of buttered popcorn invites intrigue aromatically, developing into creaminess on the body. Bacigalupi has a history of famous Chardonnay, having provided grapes for Chateau Montelena's winning Chardonnay in the 1976 Paris Tasting.
