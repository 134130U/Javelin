Blackberry jam, cherry blossom and a touch of baking spice show on the nose of this wine from a Westside Paso property. Nicely tight and bright on the palate, it is structured with fine-grained tannins.It offers blueberries, clove spice and a rocky character throughout the sip, especially into the finish.
