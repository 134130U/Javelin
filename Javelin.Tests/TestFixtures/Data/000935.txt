Deep blueberry, prune and dried purple aromas are made even more delicious by hints of bacon fat on this blend of 60% Petite Sirah, 30% Syrah, 9% Mourv√®dre and 1% Grenache. The vintner lives in the historic Uvas Valley between Gilroy and Morgan Hill. Purple fruit juiciness is balanced by a sharp licorice edge, framed by judicious acidity and tannins.
