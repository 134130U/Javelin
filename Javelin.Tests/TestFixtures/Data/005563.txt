Produced from vines around the showpiece medieval ch√¢teau of Monbazillac, this is a lightly honeyed, fresh and orange marmalade-flavored wine. It has botrytis to give the proper dry core along with a rich feel that is just cut with acidity. It's delicious now and will get better. Drink now, or wait until 2016.
