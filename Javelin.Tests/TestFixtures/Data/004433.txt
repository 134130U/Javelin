Juslyn's wines are made in a tannic style. The suggestion here is ageabiity. This bottle, which is mainly Cabernet Sauvignon but also contains Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, is not drinkable now, unless you're immune to astringency. It's future is uncertain, but you might try aging it until 2020.
