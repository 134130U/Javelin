This is tight, toasty and focused upon opening, with highlights of green olive and a core of mixed tree fruits. Excellent concentration, vivid acidity and a suggestion of wet rock contribute to a well-balanced wine with structure and length. The framing here is just right, with 30% new oak adding subtle threads of light wood flavors. Decant or cellar till 2020 before drinking.
