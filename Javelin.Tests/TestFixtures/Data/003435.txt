Cinnamon and pepper add interest to the ripe blueberry fruit on the nose of this wine. The palate has the same generous, spicy flavors, with enough freshness to provide tension. The tannins are ripe but firm, framing all the juicy, dark and brooding fruit with perfect counterpoint. This is refreshing and intriguing.
