Assembled from the same lots as the winery's more expensive varietal wines, this high-powered, Bordeaux-style blend is one of Walla Walla's best values. Big and bursting with dark-fruit flavors of fig, black cherry and cassis, the barrel aging adds espresso and chocolate in generous amounts. There's noticeable heat on the finish, but no lack of potent flavor.
