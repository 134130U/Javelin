Baga, a grape unique to the Bairrada region, has a reputation for producing tough wines when young. This wine, however, shows the potential of aging the variety. Ripe and rich in character, this wine marries powerful blackberry tones with brooding, structured tannins. It could still age further, but the wine is very drinkable now.
