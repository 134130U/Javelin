This wasn't an easy vintage in Central Otago, which makes this 2009 all the more remarkable. Scents of pine needles, damp earth, rosemary, brown sugar and cherries are complex and beguiling, while on the palate the wine is lightweight and silky, with a delicate core of wiry acidity that holds everything together. Drink nowâ€“2020.
