This is Cape Mentelle's biggest selling wine in the U.S., and one taste makes it clear why. It's got some of the herbal and passion fruit notes of Sauvignon Blanc, balanced by the strong citrus of Semillon. It's clean, crisp and long on the finish, with a lightly silky texture that lingers. Drink now.
