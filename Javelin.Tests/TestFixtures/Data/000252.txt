Sourced from the estate vineyard—the same vineyard that fuels the Private Stash reserve—this shows a dusty, somewhat charred character, presumably from the barrel aging. Along with the slightly burnt toast character comes plenty of black cherry fruit, and acids that leave a slightly chalky impression in the finish.
