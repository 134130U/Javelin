Crisp in green apple and lemon, this light Chardonnay, only 12.4% in alcohol, will sweep you off your feet with Thai food, seafood or as a before-dinner quaff. From an un-grafted, old Wente clone vineyard found abandoned (thus the name), it has a trace of salinity throughout and a lurking layer of Asian spice.
