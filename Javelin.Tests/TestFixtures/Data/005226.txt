This 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 45% Merlot wine is ripe and spicy. Solid fruit gives a juicy character along with a strong sense of structure. That allows room for plenty of acidity as well as fruit, but also demands aging to allow the mineral texture to soften. Along with owner Monique Bonnet's Ch√¢teau Suau, this vineyard was certified French organic with the 2012 vintage. Drink from 2018.
