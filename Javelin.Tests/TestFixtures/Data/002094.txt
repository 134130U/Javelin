With grapes from 40-year-old vines, this is a dense and concentrated wine. Yellow fruit as well as crisper citrus flavors give a balance between richness and freshness. It has high alcohol that shows in the light pepper edge although this doesn't detract from the fruitiness of the aftertaste. Drink from 2017.
