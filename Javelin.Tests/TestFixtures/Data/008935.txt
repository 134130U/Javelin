Ripe, deep, cedary and mildly raisiny on the nose, this high-alcohol Malbec is generous and full up front, with accents of prune and graphite. The palate is loaded with extracted berry fruit and oak. Flavors of blackberry, mocha, toast and licorice are highly appealing, while chocolaty oak, clove and black-fruit notes push the finish. Drink through 2018.
