Blended from several Central Otago subregions, this is a supple, immediately drinkable wine. Oak spice and vanilla notes mark the nose, while the midpalate fills in with crisp red fruit reminiscent of cranberries. It's medium bodied, with a silky texture that lingers on the finish. Drink nowâ€“2022.
