Aromatically compelling, this offers a complex mix of clover, chocolate and cherry in the nose. It is a substantial, fruit-packed wine, with cherry and plum fruit, a full-bodied midpalate, mouthfilling texture and nicely integrated barrel spices. It finishes with a streak of Meyer lemon acidity. Drink now through 2030.
