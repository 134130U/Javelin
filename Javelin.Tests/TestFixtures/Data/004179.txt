This is a barrel-aged, punch-in-the-face blend of 62% Grenache and 38% Mourv√®dre from Santa Maria-based winemaker Dave Corey, who sources most of his fruit from the Cuyama Valley. Its cherry syrup nose dives into a thick, juicy palate, heavily spiced with tobacco, laden with chalky tannins and ending with vanilla.
