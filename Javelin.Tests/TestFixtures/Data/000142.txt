There is tons of lively action packed into the nose of this wine, from rosebuds and zesty cherry cola to cinnamon spice and rainbow peppercorns. The texture is relatively light on the sip, and yet grippy tannins and a bursting acidity swim across the palate, showing vibrant iron and red-fruit flavors.
