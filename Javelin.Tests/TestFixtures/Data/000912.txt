The Daou brothers have become increasingly known for their rich, unctuous and lavish high-end wines, but this bottling offers a taste of that opulence for just $30. Plump blueberry and soft, cedar-like spice scents show on the nose, while the palate bursts with black cherry, dark chocolate and caramel flavors, powered by ample acidity. It will age gracefully, but is already delicious.
