This ripe, full-bodied wine has ripe green fruits that are lifted by lime and made richer by apricot. Still young, with a concentrated structure, it's going to develop into a full, beautifully fruity wine. The name of the wine means the size of a parcel that demands the work of seven men for a day. Drink from 2017.
