This is a sweet Gewurztraminer, almost a dessert style. The name comes from a title whose origins date back to the Dark Ages in Europe. The wine is rich, now fully matured, a wonderful medley of ripe fruits, honey and spice. Layers of flavors are interspersed with acidity that lifts the wine. It's opulent, delicious and ready to drink.
