This structured yet polished wine, made from a blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Aglianico and 20% Merlot, opens with intense aromas of tilled earth, mature black fruit, leather, graphite and spice. The Juicy palate offers fleshy blackberry, black currant, black pepper and mineral alongside silky smooth tannins. Hold for more complexity. Drink 2015â€“2025.
