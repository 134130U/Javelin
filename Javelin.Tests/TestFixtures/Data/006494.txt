Dense and hearty, this has subtle aromas of stewed prune, espresso and French oak. The brawny palate offers blackberry extract, licorice, ground pepper and the heat of evident alcohol alongside tightly packed, close-grained tannins that leave an astringent finish. Give the tannins another year or two to unfurl then drink up before the remaining fruit dries up.
