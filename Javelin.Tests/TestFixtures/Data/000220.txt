Produced for Force Majeure by Syncline's James Mantone, this riveting wine is a blend of 47% Mourv√®dre, 42% Syrah and 11% Grenache. Lush and redolent with wild berry and wet rock aromatics, it carries a thread of sweet grain along with bright, detailed berry fruit and balancing acidity. Delicious already, it can be enjoyed now through 2020.
