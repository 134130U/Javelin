This is a wine that is beginning to show some fine maturity. There are ripe fruits still very present, but they are matched by the secondary flavors, spice and warm tannins along with the classic herbal character of Mourv√®dre. The wine is produced from organically grown grapes, giving purity as well as some serious structure in the background. Drink from 2018.
