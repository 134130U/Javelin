Named after the year 2008, when Provence's La Londe became its own appellation, the wine is an impressive selection from specific parcels in the dry coastal slip between Toulon and Saint-Tropez. It is textured, full of ripe fruit, red berries and a squeeze of lemon juice. The wine is full bodied, rich and likely to age for a few more months. Drink from early 2018.
