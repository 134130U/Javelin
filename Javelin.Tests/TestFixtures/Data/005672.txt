This winery, with its Los Alamitos tasting room east of Long Beach, sources from a variety of vineyards to make some impressive wines. This bottling shows crushed black pepper, tar, roasted lamb and savory herb notes on the nose. The palate is tangy with underripe boysenberry, thyme, black tea and roasted lamb flavors.
