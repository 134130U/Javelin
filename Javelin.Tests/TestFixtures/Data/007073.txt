Charred-earth, espresso, French oak and menthol aromas unfold on this full-bodied red while a plum note lingers in the background. The subdued palate is rather evolved, showing raisin, toast, spirits and licorice but not much fruit richness. Assertive, close grained tannins provide the bracing framework.
