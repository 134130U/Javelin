A tender, floral aroma hovers over the glass in this typical Viennese field blend. The fresh, brightly toned palate sings with a host of flavors: crisp green apple, fragrant grape, zesty citrus and juicy yellow pear. A phenolic, spicy edge gives it depth and appeal. A real glassful of Vienna that's dry and delicious.
