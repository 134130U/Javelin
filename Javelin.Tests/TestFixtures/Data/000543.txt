Situated close to the northern edge of Beaune vineyards, this premier cru has something of the soft ripeness of Savigny-l√®s-Beaune next door. The wine is ripe, with tannins that are present although certainly not dominant. It has the potential to revel in its red fruits and generous texture. Drink this wine from 2019.
