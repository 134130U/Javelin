Deep ruby in color, with aromas of black cherry, chocolate and sage, this blend has enticing flavors of blackberry, cherry, salted caramel and menthol. Fruit and savory tones are well integrated alongside smooth tannins, and the bright finish shows a lasting note of menthol. Fine Terroir Selections, Misa Imports.
