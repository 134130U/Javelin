Winemaker Jonathan Nagy's new program includes sourcing from iconic sites around Santa Barbara County, like this vineyard high above the Santa Ynez River. The wine's deep mulberry aromas meet with hickory smoke and miso-like umami notes on the nose. Cranberry fruit shows on the palate, with nori and roasted pork accents.
