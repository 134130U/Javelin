Made from a rare and nearly extinct grape variety of the same name, Sirica opens with intense aromas of blackberry, leather, violets, underbrush and Mediterranean herbs. The delicious palate doles out mature black cherry, blueberry, black pepper, clove and grilled sage alongside velvety tannins and fresh acidity. It's beautifully balanced and will continue to evolve well over the next decade.
