Moorooduc's estate Pinot Noir is a solid value among the boutique offerings from the Mornington Peninsula. There's a supple cushioning of flesh wrapped around a firm backbone of acid, while the flavors run from black cherry and mint through earthier notes of brown sugar and roasted parsnip. Drink now through 2020.
