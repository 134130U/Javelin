Sourced entirely from the Otis Harlan Vineyard, these vines were planted about 25 years ago. It's a pleasure to see them singled out for this showcase bottling. It's a rich, oily, nutty, buttery style to be sure, but also dense with ripe apple, pear and peach fruit. The acidity buoys it up throughout a strong, long finish.
