Turkey Flat's rosé has been an Aussie staple for more than decade. The 2015 is 92% Grenche, with the balance a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz, Dolcetto and Mataro. Crushed stone and red berry scents lead the way, followed by flavors that are reminiscent of white chocolate and strawberries. It's fairly weighty for a rosé, with a long, slightly viscous finish.
