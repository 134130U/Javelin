This blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot, 10% Petit Verdot and 5% Cabernet Franc starts with aromas of black fruit, earth, cedar wood and exotic spices. The densely concentrated, one-dimensional palate delivers fleshy black cherry accented with black pepper and licorice alongside round tannins. It's already accessible so enjoy soon.
