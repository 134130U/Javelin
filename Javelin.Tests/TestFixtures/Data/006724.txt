Here's another exceptional Oregon Riesling to add to the growing ranks of top producers. Lemon-drop fruit meets peaches and cream in the mouth, as this off-dry (20g/L) wine displays a spot-on balance between acid, sugar, fruit and honey. This is delicious already, and built to age nicely over a decade or longer.
