From the flagship MÃ©doc estate of Bordeaux negociant Dourthe, this wine is impressive, ripe and ready to age well. The wood aging still shows slightly but that is already compensated for by the ripe black-currant fruits from the 66% Cabernet Sauvignon and the generous texture. Drink this wine from 2023.
