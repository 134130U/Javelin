Dark fruits and graceful highlights of black tea, citrus oil, tobacco and mocha make this an endlessly fascinating wine with impressive complexity. Give it extended breathing time and it rewards you with layer after layer of silky fruit, leaf and spice. This is a 20-year wine, but may be enjoyed immediately with ample airing.
