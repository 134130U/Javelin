Complexities of cedar, vanilla and dark toast integrate elegantly into this rich intensely blackberried wine. It's still vibrantly fruity, yet showing developing nuances of earth and mineral as well. Briskly composed and fringed in supple tannins, it finishes on lingering tones of bramble and spice.
