Roasted berry and plum aromas are earthy and leathery. This wine feels raw on the palate, with snappy acidity. Flavors of herb-infused tomato and briny plum finish oaky and spicy, with a forced note of clove. This blend of Merlot, Shiraz, Tempranillo and Viognier is not your typical Chilean red blend.
