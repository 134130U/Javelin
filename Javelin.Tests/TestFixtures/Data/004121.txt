This is a big, tough, tight and somewhat puzzling Pinot Noir. It's bone dry, moderate in alcohol and tart in acidity, with sour red cherry, cranberry, Dr. Pepper cola and new French oak flavors. It's hard and rude right now, although its inherent elegance shines through. The question is ageability. Give it until 2018 and see what it's doing.
