Still tight and young, this tastes like a keeper that will improve with time. Aged in all new American barrels, it shows aromas of coriander, cumin and smoke, with flavors like black cherry and black pepper. It balances well between firm tannins, good acidity and full flavors, and everything sails through the finish. Best after 2018.
