This is a well-constructed, with 95% of the grapes from Napa Valley and the rest supplied from nearby Lake County. Merlot makes up 85% of the wine; the remainder is Cabernet Sauvignon. Hearty, it offers juicy plum and black cherry as well as streaks of cedar and black pepper. The tannins are soft and integrated while the finish hints at mocha and chocolate.
