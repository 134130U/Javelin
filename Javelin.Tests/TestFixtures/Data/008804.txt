Red berry, chopped herb, toast and a whiff of French oak are some of the aromas that take shape in the glass. The palate is taut but elegant, offering bright wild cherry, licorice and vanilla flavors, while tightly wound, fine-grained tannins leave a firm finish. Give this time to unwind and fully develop.
