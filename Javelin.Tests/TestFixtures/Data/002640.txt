This 100% varietal wine provides a perfect spot to explore this up-and-coming vineyard. Aromas of herbs and barrel spice are all high toned, with the fruit still seeming locked up. The sweet black-fruit flavors provide significantly more generosity, with the lightly dry tannins bringing some grip. Pair it with a juicy steak and it will surely unfold.
