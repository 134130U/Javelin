A blend of fruit from Watermill, Funk, Lewis and Anna Marie vineyards, the aromas bring vibrant notes of flowers, ham hock, berry, tapenade, herb and ember. The palate is plush yet elegant and silky in feel, showing an exquisite mix of fruit and savory flavors along with outrageous hang time on the finish. It shows a lot of subtlety.
