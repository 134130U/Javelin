From one of the villages that lies behind the primary Chardonnay vineyards of the CÃ´te de Beaune, this is already smooth, fruity and perfumed. It has attractive acidity and a rich, baked apple character that is pointed up by the layer of toastiness. Drink now, although the wine will be better from 2017.
