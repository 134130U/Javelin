This blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 25% Petit Verdot offers aromas of ripe black-skinned fruit, blue flowers, vineyard dust and dark cooking spices. The firm palate delivers black currants, licorice, cinnamon, ground pepper and Mediterranean herbs. Bracing tannins offer support and leave an astringent, drying finish.
