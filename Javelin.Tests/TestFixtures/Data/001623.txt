Made from organically farmed grapes, this hearty blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo opens with earthy aromas of violets, iris, mature black fruit and leather. The juicy, ripe palate delivers fleshy black cherry, truffle, tobacco, black pepper and mint alongside solid tannins. It has a meaty, rustic note but it's delicious.
