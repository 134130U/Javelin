An intense bouquet of blackberry, smoked meat, flint and violet paves the way for flavors of black currant, smoked meat, coffee bean and a hint of cranberry. Rich savory notes mingle with strong fruit flavors, all marked by a pleasingly persistent strain of tartness. Smooth, soft tannins prime the palate for the elegant finish.
