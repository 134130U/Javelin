Here's a gorgeous, delicious wine that's all about sheer elegance. It's loaded with alluring blue flower, creamy wild cherry and black raspberry sensations accented by notes of carob, clove and white pepper. This is impeccably balanced, with fresh acidity, silky, smooth tannins and a long, lingering finish. It already boasts great depth and complexity, but will continue to evolve for years.
