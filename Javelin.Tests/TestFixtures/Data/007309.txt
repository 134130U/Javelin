Complex and compelling in dark plum and dusty dark chocolate, this Cabernet has under 3% Petit Verdot and under 3% Cabernet Franc blended in, providing the wine with elegance and concentration. Soft on the palate, it suggests vanilla oak with subtlety, bringing all the components together on the lingering finish.
