This is a powerful wood-aged wine that is currently exhibiting dark chocolate and coffee flavors from new, smoky oak. It's the weight of the juicy fruit underneath that reveals the promise of aging. There is a mineral texture that shows the schist soil of the vineyard, all part of the dense mix. Drink from 2018.
