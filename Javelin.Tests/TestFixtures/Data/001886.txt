From 100% estate-grown Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot grown in the heart of the Stags Leap District, this earthy red offers black tea and coffee aromas and flavors, suggestions of wild sage and black pepper enveloping the nose. Medium to full-bodied, elegant and well-composed, the tannins are soft and structured, the wine able to age, drinking well now through 2020.
