Made from the local grapes Bogazkere and Öküzgözü, this wine features aromas of black cherry, white chocolate and orange peel. A bright cherry flavor with notes of orange zest is set against a more complex backdrop of cooked cherries with touches of mocha and eucalyptus. Smooth, long-lasting tannins linger on the palate, joined by a final burst of pomegranate.
