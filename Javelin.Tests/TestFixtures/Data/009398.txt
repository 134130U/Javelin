Starting off with grapefruit soda and apple-pear cider aromas, this well-priced Chardonnay is made by the Miller family of Bien Nacido Vineyard fame in honor of the brand's late founder. It features the steadily evolving flavor profile of wines twice its price. The citrus soda element is first, followed by a distinct, slightly bitter pear-peel profile on the midpalate, finishing with lingering vanilla toffee.
