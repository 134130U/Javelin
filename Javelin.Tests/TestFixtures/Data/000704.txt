Ripe fruit and oak loom large in this wine, produced from relatively old vines in the heart of the appellation, long a source for the producer's Pinot Noir. Preserved lemon, fleshy melon and caramel dance around each other, steeped in Golden Delicious apple, honey and pear. A high wire of acidity marks the finish.
