Made entirely with Merlot, this densely extracted wine opens with aromas of toasted oak, black currants and vanilla. The tightly packed palate delivers dried blackberries, tobacco, espresso and licorice alongside raspy wood tannins that leave an astringent finish. It lacks the fruit richness to stand up to the heavy oak influence.
