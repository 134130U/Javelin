From the head-trained, dry-farmed Martinelli Vineyard, this wine is like a lens into history. It's mighty flavorful, too, with jubilant cinnamon, rose water and wisteria aromas and a rounded and juicy palate of plum and boysenberry fruit. Asssertive baking spice notes and chalky tannins complete the picture.
