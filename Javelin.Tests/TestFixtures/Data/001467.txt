This ambitious blend of 60% Sangiovese, 15% Merlot, 15% Petite Sirah and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon largely succeeds, with aromas of tight blueberries, concentrated purple flowers and a touch of crushed peppercorn. The fruit-driven palate is dense with blueberry, tart boysenberry and a dusting of cocoa.
