The Dead Arm is always firmly structured, making it one of the more challenging Shiraz to judge in its youth. The 2010 is full-bodied and chewy, characterized by dark, earthy and umami notes of roasted meat, asphalt and grilled mushrooms. The length and ripely tannic nature of the finish is reassuring. Drink 2018â€“2030.
