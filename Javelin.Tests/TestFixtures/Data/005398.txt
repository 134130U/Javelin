Damask rose and honeysuckle on the nose almost have a cotton-candy tang to them. The palate is medium sweet and adds peach compote to the floral notes and a dollop of plump luscious sweetness. There is huge concentration and big aromatic intensity on the midpalate with a lovely bitter edge that lasts long. There is a medium-sweet finish.
