Boasting a distinct aroma of both roasted and candied walnuts, this Viognier is probably best suited for those who love California Chardonnay. The palate is luxuriously soft, delivering peach and toasted oak on the midpalate and vanilla on the finish, but the acidity is perfectly incorporated throughout.
