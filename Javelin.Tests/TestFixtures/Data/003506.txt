Don't let the generic California appellation fool you, this is a distinctive Chardonnay. It has subtle flavors of pear and toasted oak, and shows a sophisticated and restrained style, with a vibrant fruit core and good balance. Though medium bodied, it plays crisp acidity off a lush texture and lingers on the finish.
