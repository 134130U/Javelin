You could get lost in the enticing fragrance of this wine thanks to wild berry, blue flower, baking spice, chopped herb and saddle leather aromas. The smooth, elegantly structured palate is just as inviting, doling out juicy black cherry, raspberry, cinnamon and white pepper flavors. Polished tannins and fresh acidity lend balance and support. An impressive effort from this wineryâ€”one of Montalcino's little known gems.
