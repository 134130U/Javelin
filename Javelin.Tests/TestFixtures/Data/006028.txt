This corner of the Carmel Valley can make some awesome Pinot Noir, and in this wine's case, it presents an amazing bouquet that starts with spearmint and moves to olive tapenade, cooked strawberry and rhubarb, with some barnyard gaminess on the edges. The flavors are distinctiveâ€”tart berries to charred lamb to rosemary, thyme, clove and crushed herbs.
