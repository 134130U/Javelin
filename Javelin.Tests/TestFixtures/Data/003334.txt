A herbal touch of crushed lemon balm and apple peel makes for an intriguing, inviting nose. The palate adds fresh apple notes to these subtle herb notes and remains totally juicy and lively. This seems far fresher than its six years and the herbal tinges are just the beginning of maturity. This is lovely, concentrated and spirited stuff with a whistle-clean utterly dry finish. Testaments to Riesling's longevity.
