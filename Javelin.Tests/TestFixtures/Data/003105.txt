This youthful ten-year-old demonstrates the impressive aging potential of well-made Greco di Tufo, opening with compelling dried stone fruit, Spanish broom, herb and smoky aromas. The round, smooth palate doles out creamy peach, mature Bartlett pear and lemon drop flavors. An energizing mineral note lingers on the finish. It's at its peak so drink now.
