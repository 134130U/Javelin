This doesn't appear to be the strongest recent vintage of this wine, but it remains a benchmark for McLaren Vale Shiraz. Hints of vanilla and tobacco leaf add nuance to a mix of berries ranging from red raspberry to black currant, but there's also a hint of bruised fruit and a green toughness to the tannins. Give it some time in the cellar. Drink 2020â€“2030.
