This is a ripe, lush wine with aromas of raisin, blackberry, dried herbs and sandalwood. The mouthfeel is grand and wide, with big tannins and lemony acidity. Flavors of blackberry, fig, vanilla and chocolate are highly likeable, while the finish is rich but not overly deep or structured. Drink through 2019.
