The wine, with its 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, is solidly structured with plenty of the firmness that is characteristic of young Saint-Est√®phe. To go with this structure, the wine is also full of perfumed black fruits that are already delicious. It will be a rich serious wine as it develops over the next several years. Drink from 2022.
