Aromas of dark berry, wild flower, Mediterranean brush and dried herb lead the nose on this structured wine. The ripe, delicious palate boasts juicy red cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon and anise flavors that are framed in velvety tannins. It's balanced and elegant, with an energizing mineral finish. Drink through 2022.
