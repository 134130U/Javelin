Leather, truffle, black cherry, grilled herb and a whiff of mocha lead the nose on this structured but straightforward wine. The palate is still rather closed but delivers crushed red cherry, white pepper and grilled herb alongside fresh acidity and young, raspy tannins that need time to soften. Drink 2018â€“2028.
