This is the product of two childhood friends, both of whom grew up in the wine business in Napa Valley. Taken, if this wine is any indication, aims to offer great Napa Valley wine at affordable prices. This Cabernet-Merlot blend is smooth in juicy red and blue fruit and completely silky tannins, completely satisfying for all kinds of scenarios.
