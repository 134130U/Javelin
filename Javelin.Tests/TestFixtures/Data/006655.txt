Honeysuckle and orange blossom aromas are pristine on this dry, luxuriously textured Riesling. Ripe melon and stone fruit flavors drench the palate in lush waves, accented by cool tones of steel and acid. Enjoy now for its lavish perfume and fruit, but even more from 2020 for intense textural complexity.
