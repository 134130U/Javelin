Made with native grapes Nerello Mascalese and Nocera, this bright wine delivers aromas of perfumed berry, blue flower and a whiff of cake spice. The sleek palate delivers wild cherry, crushed strawberry, clove, cinnamon, orange peel and thyme alongside firm, polished tannins. It finishes on a mineral note. Drink through 2018.
