Extremely deep and nearly impenetrable aromas of black cherry fruit mix with a bit of creosote and a tiny whiff of fresh raspberry on this nose of this wine from a relatively unexplored appellation in San Benito County. It's dense and heavy on the palate, with decent acidity and tannins, making for a pleasant dark sipper.
