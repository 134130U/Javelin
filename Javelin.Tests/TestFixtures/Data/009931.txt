A bright purple tint announces a jumpy youthful-smelling wine with plum, black currant and oak aromas. This is Carignan, Syrah, Garnacha and Cab Sauvignon, and it's full in body but also juicy and lively. Savory, saucy plum and berry flavors ride a wave of crisp acidity, while the finish feels dry and exact, with minty medicinal overtones. Drink this snappy wine through 2021.
