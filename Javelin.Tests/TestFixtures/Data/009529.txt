Pepi is doing a great job lately making inexpensive white wines, and with this Sauvignon Blanc, the winery really knocks it out of the park. This is bone dry, mouthwateringly tart in acidity and complex, offering flavors of green grass, gooseberry, lime, vanilla and white pepper. It should be relatively easy to find thanks to its production of 10,000 cases.
