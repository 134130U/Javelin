Production is only about one-tenth as much as the Willamette Valley cuv√©e. For a couple bucks more you get a tight, less opulently fruity wine, with compact skin flavors over-riding fruit flesh. Hints of apple, pear and peach accompany a streak of minerality, and the persistence suggests that this will age nicely. Drink 2020 through 2026.
