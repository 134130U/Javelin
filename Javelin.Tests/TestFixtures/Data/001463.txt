From the heart of the Rutherford Bench, this estate-grown wine is a classic version of restraint and elegance, structured in dusty tannin with bursts of cedar, tomato leaf and cassis. Cabernet Franc makes up 8% of the blend, with 3% Merlot. This will benefit from time in the cellar; drink 2020â€“2023.
