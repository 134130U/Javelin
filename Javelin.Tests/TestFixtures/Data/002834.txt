Blueberries and black cherries meet with rose petals, dark chocolate, brown spice and black tea on the nose of this bottling from a historic vineyard. The mouthfeel is soft with creamy tannins that grow grippier across the sip, showing cedar, black-cherry mousse, baking spice and a tinge of acidity.
