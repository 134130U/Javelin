The apogee of this ambitious winery's white wine efforts, this bottling of just two barrels of Clone 5 shows focused marzipan, marcona almond and white peach notes on the nose. The palate sizzles with saltiness and a lemony acidity that cuts through its brown butter richness with finesse. The finish is luxurious and long.
