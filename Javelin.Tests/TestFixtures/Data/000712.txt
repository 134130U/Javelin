Not just an intriguing wine that geeks will love to find, this bottling of Charbono is intriguing and accessible to lovers of many different styles. Rich but fruity aromas of boysenberry, black plum, hoisin sauce and wood smoke give way to a palate laced with more plum and rounded purple fruit as well as touches of graphite and gravel.
