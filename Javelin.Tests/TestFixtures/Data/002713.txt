Bracingly effervescent bubbles offer aromas of baking soda, chalk and blood orange on this South Coast sparkler made from 82% Chardonnay and 18% Pinot Noir. The foamy palate offers inviting bubblegum and light cotton candy flavors, never sweet but very rounded and approachable in a crowd-pleasing way.
