A 60-some-year-old vineyard, untrellised and low yielding, Esola is a longtime source of this 100% Zinfandel made by Amador Foothill for some time. Still young, it offers a taste of raspberry cordial amid smooth, ripe tannins and cinnamon spice. Lay it down until 2017â€“2019 and it'll soften some more.
