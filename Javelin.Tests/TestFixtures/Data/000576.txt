One of the finest whites of the vintage, this exquisite bottling has an enticing bouquet of almond, orchard fruit, almond and chopped herb. The elegantly structured palate delivers mouthwatering peach, apricot, almond and energizing mineral ntoes that carry over to the long, lingering finish, along with a hint of tangerine.
