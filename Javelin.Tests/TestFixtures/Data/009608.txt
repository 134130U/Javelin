Maturity gives a bruised apple aroma to the generous mellowness of ripe pear on the nose. The palate is more taut than the nose leads you to expect, but there is concentration and richness and more bruised apple skin texture. Fruit, evolved flavors and freshness make for an intriguing wine. Drink soon.
