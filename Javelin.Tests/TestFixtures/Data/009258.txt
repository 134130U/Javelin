Give this wine your full attention and it continues to give back. Tart young strawberry and black cherry fruit flavors are set in a frame of light toast and juicy acid. With perfect balance, good length and emerging details, more complexity should develop as this wine ages. Suggestion: cellar until 2018â€“2020.
