Alluring aromas of vanilla, cedar, tobacco and blackberry are well-knit and exemplify fine modern Rioja in a good vintage. The palate is tight and wiry, with forceful acidity. Flavors of blackcurrant and berry are bright but come with a rich, oaky accent of coconut. A fresh, full, angular, juicy finish indicates that this will stay in good shape through at least 2020.
