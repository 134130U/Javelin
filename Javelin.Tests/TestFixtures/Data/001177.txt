The biggest production and lowest priced of all the winery's vineyard designates, this is sexy, substantial and one of the best offerings from any winery sourcing fruit from this exceptional vineyard. A riot of berries, plums and Asian spices fills the mouthâ€”well-integrated, layered and detailed right on through the extended finish. A light dusting of cocoa powder lingers and invites the next sip.
