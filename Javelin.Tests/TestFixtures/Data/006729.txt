This is one of the producer's more full-bodied wines, a blend from several sites along Eastside Road, including Calegari, Foss and a new sourceâ€”Lewis MacGregor Estate. Rich, round and plush, it's as strong as black coffee in its marriage of earthy allspice, baked cherry, blueberry and smoke. Moderate acidity allows for an underlying minerality.
