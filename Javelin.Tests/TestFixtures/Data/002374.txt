On the basis that anything goes with ros√©, this wine is 100-percent Sangiovese, known locally as Niellucciu. The acidity that is typical of the grape is very present as are red cherry and tight fruit flavors. It is so crisp and lively, bouncing from the glass and leaving a beautiful array of red fruits at the end.
