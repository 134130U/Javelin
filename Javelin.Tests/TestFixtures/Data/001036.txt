Whiffs of blackberry, bramble and granite seduce throughout this concentrated, brawny Lemberger. The palate is lush, with ripe plum and black cherry flavors anchored by brooding minerality and a bite of firm tannins on the finish. It's lovely now, but should reveal more complexity with 5â€“7 years in the cellar.
