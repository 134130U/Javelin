Black plum, berry, violet petal and ultimately raisiny ripeness define the nose on this dark and lusty Priorato. A ripe, saturated, muscular palate is home to blackberry, baked plum and spice flavors, while burnt brown sugar, pepper and herbal flavors dance comfortably on a deep, lengthy finish. Drink through 2018.
