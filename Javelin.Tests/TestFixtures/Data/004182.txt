Charred beef tips, grilled whole fish, wet dirt and heavy tar combine for a pungent, serious nose on this Syrah from a vineyard planted by Central Coast pioneer Dale Hampton. It's elegant and soft on the palate, opening up with boysenberry and sage, and possesses ample tannins for aging. Hang on until 2018.
