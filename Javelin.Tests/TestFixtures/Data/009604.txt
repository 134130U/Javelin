One of Dan Kessler's many Pinot bottlings, this shows tart but deep black plum skin aromas, with boysenberry, lavender, hibiscus and a touch of candied cherry. The palate shows both red cherry ripeness and fresh pomegranate tang, with a focus on floral elements of lavender and rose, presented like a bouquet on the tongue.
