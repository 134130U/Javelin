Sesame oil, cracked peppercorns, pencil lead and charred oak serve as the savory side to aromatic elements of dried strawberries and olallieberries on the nose of this bottling. Upright but not chunky tannins frame the palate, where dried blueberry, beef char and rosemary converge for a complex and very dry flavor profile.
