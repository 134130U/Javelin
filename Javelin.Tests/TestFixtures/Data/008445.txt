While this wine comes out of the gate showing little but earth and dark fruit aromas, it lightens and develops more delineation with air, eventually revealing berry, plum and spice notes. Right now, the flavors are almost jammy, so purists may want to wait a few years before opening a bottle. Full-bodied, chewy and rich, this superripe Hermitage should age well for up to 15 years.
