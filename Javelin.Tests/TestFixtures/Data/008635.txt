The winery's robust blend of Sangiovese, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon, some of which comes from Monte Rosso, is structured and surprisingly high-toned, offering herbal cherry, raspberry, cigar box and peppery spice. Aged in bottle for a while, it's enjoyable now and has the bones to get better; try after 2016.
