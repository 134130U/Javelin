A lovely mix of gentle rose petal, sandalwood and honeysuckle perfumes the nose. The palate has an earthy element, grounding these flavors and a texture of silky peach skin, along with soft peachy fruit. The body is light and lifted—an almost weightless pleasure—but with concentration and lasting flavors. This is a compact bundle of aromatic joy.
