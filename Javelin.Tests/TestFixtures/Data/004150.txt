This is quite a funky, gamey blend of 33% Grenache, 33% Syrah, 30% Mourv√®dre and 4% Alicante Bouschet, with beef carpaccio, concentrated plum and tobacco aromas. Dried beef, dried purple-flowers, asphalt, condensed black-pepper and deep balsamic-reduction flavors are laced through a charred palate.
