Dark berry, mineral and baked notes control the nose on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmen√®re, Petit Verdot and Syrah. This is full, round and firmly tannic, with oaky, minty flavors of black fruits and licorice root. Mocha, tobacco, chocolate and coffee flavors are nice on the finish. Drink through 2018.
