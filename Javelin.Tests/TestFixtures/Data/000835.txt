Dried purple flowers and dark cardamom spices are layered across aromas of blackberry, roast beef, soy, jerky and peppercorn on the nose of this blend of 52% Syrah, 40% Mourv√®dre and 8% Grenache. A solid, nearly chewy structure unveils dark flavors of beef char, pencil lead, blueberries and a touch of asphalt.
