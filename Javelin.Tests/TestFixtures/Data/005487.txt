Black cherry, blueberry jam, volcanic rocks, river stones and a mace spice show on the nose of this wine. The palate is thick with black fruit and dark chocolate, the tannins showing lots of structure and flavors of purple flowers giving depth. It needs more time in the bottle to reach full potential.
