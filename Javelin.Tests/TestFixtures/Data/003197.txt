An oxidized style of the grape, this shows dried apricot, marzipan and macadamia nuts on the nose, all cut with a lemon juice freshness. Once sipped, there are roasted nuts, dried peaches, figs and even dates on the palate, with an iodine character through the center and a lively acidity. The exotically honeyed finish is reminiscent of baklava.
