Dark, concentrated and powerful, this Carmen√®re-heavy blend pumps out huge cassis, blackberry and cola aromas in front of a racy, tannic, jet-powered palate. Baked, lemon-blackberry and cola flavors are earthy and forceful. Tobacco and cedar notes along with hard tannins push the finish. Drink through 2018.
