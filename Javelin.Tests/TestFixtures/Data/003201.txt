A self-described “irreverent blend” of Pinot Noir (70%) and Syrah (30%), Rubeo manages to capture both the finesse of the former and the power of the latter. Pinot is rarely blended in a still wine, but Lynn Penner-Ash pulls it off in in this selection, showing pretty strawberry and raspberry fruit, dusted with cinnamon, coffee and toast.
