If this wine is any indication, now is the time to jump into the 2009s from the Santa Lucia Highlands. There is verve on the nose, with a heady mix of cola, violet, sassafras and earthy funk. Then the palate delivers suave vanilla and blackberry brûlée flavors. Tannins are perfectly integrated, and it's ready to rock.
