A deeper salmon color with elegantly lacy bubbles and a slight cloudy appearance, this sparkler by Norm Yost offers dessicated watermelon, dried orange blossoms, yeast, citrus rinds and fresher strawberry notes on the nose. Tart raspberry and yeasty melon show on the palate, which offers a salty component as well as a surprising but nice amount of grip.
