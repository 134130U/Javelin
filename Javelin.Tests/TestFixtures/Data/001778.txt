This bottling from McMurray Vineyard at Rancho Sisquoc packs all of the beloved Syrah characteristics: ripe plum, blackberry and blueberry fruit, a vanilla-laced oaky frame and underlying hints of lavender and pepper. The palate offers herb and pepper touches, underscoring its black fruit and caramel flavors.
