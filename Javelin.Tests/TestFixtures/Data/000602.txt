The wine is a successful blend of various mountain vineyards. It's a classic California Cab, rich in tannins, with brisk acidity and finely-etched black currant, cassis, mineral and oak flavors. Blended with some Merlot, it's fancy and elegant, a real beauty to drink now, and will hold in the bottle until 2024.
