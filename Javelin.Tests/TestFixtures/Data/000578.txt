This lovely, layered wine from the Santa Ynez Valley-based producer shows iron, cranberry, shiitake, cola and cherry on the nose. Those same elements are delicately woven into the palate, enhanced by a Sichuan peppercorn kick and vibrant acidity that will ensure a long life ahead. Its flavors continue to unwind as it opens in the glass.
