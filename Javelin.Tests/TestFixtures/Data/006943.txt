Graphite, lemon peel, cedar and blackberry aromas are lusty and high in quality. A flashy, fresh, slick mouthfeel is the perfect vessel for toasty, dark blackberry, coconut, vanilla and mocha flavors. The mocha note persists on the finish, which is juicy and fresh but also thick and chewy. Drink through 2018.
