Dark in color and showing jammy cherry and boysenberry aromas along with resiny oak, this Tempranillo-Cabernet blend feels sticky and on the verge of cloying. Lightly herbal, green-leaning berry flavors are masked by clove and vanilla notes, while the finish is low on fruit and high on residual oak.
