Juicy while structured, this is already a well-balanced wine with dark tannins, wood flavors and a dense structure. With a firm character as well as ripe black plum fruits, it is going to develop well. This 40-acre Merlot/Cabernet Sauvignon vineyard is on a slope above the Gironde estuary punctuated by a ch√¢teau with 13th-century origins. Drink from 2018.
