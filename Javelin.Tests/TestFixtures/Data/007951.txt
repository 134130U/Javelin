This blend of 48% Counoise, 38% Mourv√®dre and 14% Grenache shows gravel, dried cherry, hibiscus and charred wood scents on the lively, fresh nose. Cooked cherry notes are dusted with vanilla and clove on the palate, where tart plum skin flavors the tannic backbone, and a smoky bacon fat finish makes it all the more delicious.
