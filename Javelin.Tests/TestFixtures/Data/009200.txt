In 2012, Balletto had its Pinots undergo natural fermentations, with beguiling results. This vintage of Burnside Road, always a standout bottling, delivers stemmy, herbal, toasty aromas around a layering of warm strawberry fruit and gorgeous earthiness. Soft, silky and seductive, it lingers on the tongue, imprinting on the pleasure centers of the brain.
