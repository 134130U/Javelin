A steely minerality underscores the taut, tart berry fruit from this estate vineyard, located in the foothills of the Coastal Range in Oregon's McMinnville AVA. It remains implacably tight and acidic, almost as if it had just recently come out of the fermenting vat. Nonetheless the structure and gravitas suggests a wine that will age.
