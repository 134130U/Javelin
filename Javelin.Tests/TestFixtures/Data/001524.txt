This attention-grabber hits the palate with reckless abandon. Stewed black plum and sugar plum aromas meet vanilla and strawberry pie scents on the lush nose. It's plush with creamy coffee, milk chocolate, blackberry and black cherry flavors, framed by soft tannins and a fine streak of acidity. Rather delicious.
