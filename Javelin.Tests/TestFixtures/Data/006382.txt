This intriguing category—white wine made from red grapes—finds another winner in this new release from Aberrant Cellars. A pale copper hue, it's rich and full bodied, loaded with flavors of poached pear. Highlights of pepper and toast give way to a finish that somehow suggests Butterfinger candy. It's flat-out gorgeous from start to finish.
