Bold, penetrating tannins and bright cranberry acidity lend a tight frame to this classically styled Blaufr√§nkisch, a.k.a. Lemberger. Crisp-tart blackberry and blueberry flavors are accented by bramble and herb notes that linger long on the finish. Its quite closed now, but should show well after 2018.
