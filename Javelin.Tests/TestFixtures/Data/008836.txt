Rarely does a Merlot in this price range display this much power and concentration. Sourced from several vineyards, it's ripe right to the border of raisin flavors, with generous dollops of maple syrup and brown sugar adding further complexity. Still fruit-driven, yet with plenty of barrel flavor, this massive Merlot can take your richest, tangiest barbecue sauce.
