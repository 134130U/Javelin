Light straw in the glass, this wine is a nice example of the indigenous Turkish grape Narince. The bouquet yields soft notes of guava and white melon, while it is much bolder on the palate, offering flavors of grapefruit, carambola, and eucalyptus. The pleasing of interplay of tropical fruit and cool notes continues into a zesty finish with touches of mint.
