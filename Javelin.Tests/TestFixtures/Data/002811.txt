This massive heavily oaked blend of 94% Tinta de Toro and 6% Garnacha smells like a cross between caf√© mocha and a sawmill, with baking spices thrown in for good measure. The palate is rough and tannic, while oaky flavors of clove dominate blackberry fruit. On the finish, more clove is apparent, while the tannic clamp is severe. Drink through 2024.
