Blackberry, blueberry, rubber and violet aromas show a pinch of cool-vintage green. The palate on this Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmen√®re-Petit Verdot-Syrah blend is tightly wound, with grating tannins. The berry flavors are a touch leafy, while the finish brings red fruit flavors and a touch of carob. Drink through 2018.
