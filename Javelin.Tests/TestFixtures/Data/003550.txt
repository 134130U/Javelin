Enticing spicy, toasty aromas and robust, dry fruit flavors are matched by very firm, fine-grained tannins in this full-bodied wine. Based on 65% Zinfandel, it has lots to offer, but at this stage an oaky sensation and the astringent mouthfeel indicate that it needs to mellow. Best to drink after 2018.
