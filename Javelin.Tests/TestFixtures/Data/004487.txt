This stellar bottling offers chaparral character on the nose, from wild mint and thyme to fennel and mountain tea, along with turned earth and raspberry scents. The plate kicks off with strawberry fruit and hibiscus, then dives into a deeper expression of grippy black plum skins, cardamom spice and boisterous acidity.
