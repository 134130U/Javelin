The mini-trend to making white Pinot Noir is taking off in Oregon, and the wines get better with each new vintage. There's not a trace of color here, but plenty of flavor, headed with chunky apple and white peach fruit. Overall fruit-forward describes this best, with some of the flesh of a good stainless Chardonnay.
