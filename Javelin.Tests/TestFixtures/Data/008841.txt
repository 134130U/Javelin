A terrific effort, this wine highlights the features that make Condrieu special. First is the incredible perfume, like honeyed stone fruit and mango. Second is the richness and texture of the wine, imparting great palate presence. Third is the vibrance of the finish, providing the counterweight to the wine's ripeness and weight. Drink it over the next few years.
