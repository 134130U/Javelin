This blend of Syrah, Grenache, Mourvèdre and Petite Sirah grapes is so packed with flavors that they seem to stumble over each other at first. It leads with a definitely earthy aroma that fades, but then the flavors come out—effusive, chocolaty, almost sweet and definitely ripe. It is full bodied and rich in texture.
