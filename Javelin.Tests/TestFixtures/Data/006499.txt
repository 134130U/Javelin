A blend of 80% Sangiovese and 20% Merlot, this robust wine shows the heat of the vintage. It opens with aromas that recall scorched earth, espresso, French oak, dark spice and a balsamic note while the warm palate offers dried black cherry, raisin, licorice and menthol framed in bracing tannins. The finish is dominated by evident alcohol that throws it somewhat off-balance.
