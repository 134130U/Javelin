The stunning 2012 vintage prompted this Buellton winery to produce this excellent reserve bottling. The nose blends dark raspberry, roasted plums and wet slate with the umami-driven scents of roasting game and black pepper. It's soft and lush once sipped, definitely a power wine packed with smoked purple fruits, but with tart acidity keeping it balanced and not boozy.
