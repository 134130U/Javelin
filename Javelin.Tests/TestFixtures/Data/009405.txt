It plays to Grenache's lighter, more refined side in color, flavor and feel. An unusual mix of fruit and savory notes includes herbs, umami, stems, cherry Jolly Rancher, green olive and wet gravel. The texture is creamy and hypnotic, gliding along to a lingering finish. A unique wine that defies easy comparison but keeps drawing you in for additional exploration.
