The Conner Lee vineyard, from which this fruit was sourced, belongs in the top five sites for Washington Chardonnay. This wine brings both pristine apple blossom scents and supple fruit flavors, with lively acidity and plenty of toast. Barrel-fermented in two-thirds new French oak, it's an especially fine value.
