This luminous Nebbiolo from the mountain vineyards of Valtellina opens with a pretty fragrance of rose petal, red berries, baking spice and a whiff of crushed rock. The understated palate delivers ripe wild cherry, cinnamon-spice, licorice and a mineral note alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2017.
