There is a hint of flinty reduction that still clings to the nose. Underneath that is shy crisp red-cherry fruit. The palate adds glimpses of lifted conifer aromas to that. There is lightness and a very fine structure, but also depth. This is very elegant and understated but all the more touching for that. The finish is totally refreshing and dry.
