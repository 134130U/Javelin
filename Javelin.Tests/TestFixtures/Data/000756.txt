Rick Longoria's light winemaking touch even plays into this Spanish grape, which is daintier than regional counterparts. Red and Bing cherries mix with purple flowers, some dried fruit and vanilla paste on the nose. The palate leans herbal, with anise and chopped Italian herbs, also showing brick minerality and oak on the finish. The wine would definitely shine brighter with food.
