Well structured and appetizingly tannic, this full-bodied wine from a consistently excellent producer has opulent fruit flavors, mouth-filling texture and wonderful ripeness. Black cherry, blackberry and a touch of cranberry meld with mild oak spicesâ€”a combination that lingers nicely on the finish. Best after 2019.
