Dark cherry and cola aromas meld with composting rose scents on the nose of this pleasing wine that will satisfy any lover of Pinot Noir. The palate exudes nutmeg, iron and rose flavors galore, adding spice to its core of plump raspberry and ripe cranberry fruit. Lively acidity and tannic depth complete the experience.
