Briary, dry, lightly oaked aromas of plum and berry lead to a bright, forward, juicy palate with fresh acidity and racy flavors of cherry and plum. This is short but clean on the finish, and overall it's the type of simple, drinkable, affordable Ribera del Duero that fans of the region don't come across often enough.
