From a particular block with limestone soils, this is indeed a light, steely and minerally white wine, given nine months in French oak, only 17% of it new. It takes on that oak with subtle concentration, offering a touch of baked pineapple, peach and vanilla, ending in a bittersweet bite of Meyer lemon.
