Jet-black aromatics of creosote, charred meats, pepper and plum-blackberry jam make an excellent entry point for this wine from a vineyard in the new Ballard Canyon appellation. Blackberry sauce leads the palate, with espresso bitterness and strong acidity throughout. A powerful but beautiful Syrah.
