The low-yielding vineyards generate concentrated aromas and flavors of cantaloupe, yellow peach, elderberry, crushed tomato vine and exotic fruit. A juicy palate is supported by fresh acidity and the lingering finish ends on a mineral note. It's crisp and delicious now but still can develop more depth. Drink through 2016.
