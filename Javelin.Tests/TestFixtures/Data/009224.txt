This creative blend of 74% Viognier, 19% Chardonnay, 4% Grenache Blanc and 3% Albari√±o delivers a juicy nose of squeezed orange and peach with tangerine-rind edge and yellow-cake warmth. There's a flash of acidity at first sip, then the flavors dive toward green apples, guava and banana, altogether both ripe and sour.
