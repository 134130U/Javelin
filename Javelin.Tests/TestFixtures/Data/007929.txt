Deep ruby to the eye, this blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot has a bouquet of coffee and black currant preserves. It offers a frankly gorgeous interplay between fruit and cool herbal flavors, with black cherry joined on the palate by licorice, eucalyptus, butterscotch and flint. The drawn-out finish offers a surprisingly bright burst that inspires taking the next sip.
