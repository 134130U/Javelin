Early aromas of raisin and prune give way to richer, more inky scents of blackberry and cassis. But all the while there's an herbal note of oregano to the nose. This has a full, clampy feel and lightly herbal, oaky flavors of graphite, resiny oak, blackberry and cassis. Oak and resin characterize the finish. Drink through 2018.
