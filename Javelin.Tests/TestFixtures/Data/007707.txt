Barrel aromas are out front on this 100% varietal wine, with notes of wood spice, vanilla, pencil lead and baking spice followed by dark plum. The flavors are dense, dark and palate coating. The wood shows quite prominently on the palate as well but if you can get beyond it, there are good things happening.
