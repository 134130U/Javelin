Intense baked plum and black cherry aromas meet with vanilla, caramel and sagebrush on the nose of this bottling from one of the appellation's most coveted vineyards. The tangy, energetic and grippy palate offers crushed cranberry flavors, more black plum, gingerbread and exotic Indian spice on the finish.
