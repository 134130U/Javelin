This is a powerful and ripe wine that is full of tannins that are now mature enough to support the broad, ripe black-fruite character. A blend of Aragonez, Alicante Bouschet and Tinta Calada, it has a dense structure, with a full-bodied juicy aftertaste. Drink now, but the wine will be better after 2015.
