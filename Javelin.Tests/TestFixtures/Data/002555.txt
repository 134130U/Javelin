Charbono is an old-fashioned variety that used to be planted in Napa Valley, before Cabernet Sauvignon took over. This bottling is bone dry and tannic, with lots of acidity. The wine is made in a style of 30 or 40 years ago, which is meant as a compliment. It's a complex, food-friendly wine of considerable interest.
