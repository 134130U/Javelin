There is a deeply sanguine sense to the nose of this appellation blend by the Buellton-based winery, with bloody meats and graphite giving way to ripe raspberry fruit, brown spices and chopped herbs. It's very spicy once sipped, with black pepper, mocha and red fruits upholding more iron and pencil-shaving flavors on the palate.
