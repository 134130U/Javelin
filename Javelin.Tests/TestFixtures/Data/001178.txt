Vinified by the former Margerum winemaker (who now works for Morgan Winery), this bottling from one of the appellation's most exciting vineyards is chock-full of baked red cherry, vanilla, clove and gravel aromas. Though light and bright in body, the palate packs intriguing flavors, from raspberry and rose petal to dried fennel and dill.
