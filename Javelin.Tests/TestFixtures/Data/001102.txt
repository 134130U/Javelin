Fresh apple aromas and lively citrus flavors make a good combination in this light-bodied, tangy-textured wine. It tastes slightly rounded with sweetness, but comes off clean, crisp and appetizing. The two main components are SÃ©millon and Chardonnay, with dashes of Sauvignon Blanc and Orange Muscat.
