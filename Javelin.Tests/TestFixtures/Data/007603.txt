Santa Barbara-raised Steve Gerbac makes a winning white wine with aromas of scorched lemons, browned butter and vanilla, sliced down the middle with white rock minerality. Broad, oak-driven flavors at the tip of the palate quickly tighten into a line of lime zest acidity that lingers, with white pepper and chamomile spices emerging in the midpalate.
