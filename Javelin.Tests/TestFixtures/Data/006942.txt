Made from 80-year old Nerello Mascalese vines, this powerfully structured wine features aromas of ripe berry, allspice, anise and Mediterranean herb. The concentrated, warm palate offers ripe black cherry, raspberry, licorice, mineral and white pepper alongside the warmth of alcohol and firm, velvety tannins.
