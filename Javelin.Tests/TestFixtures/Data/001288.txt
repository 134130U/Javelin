According to legend, the Baron of Figuiera got his foot stuck in the stirrup while riding one day. He promised that where his horse stopped, he would build a chapel, and that's where this 2,100 foot high, cool-climate vineyard is today. The wine is crisp and fresh, with attractive citrus notes and plenty of refreshing acidity. Drink now.
