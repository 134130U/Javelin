Juicy, vivid black cherry fruit appears on the nose of this wine, with a touch of tar and brooding elderberry. The palate brims with those appetizing flavors and adds an edge of licorice to the fruit. It's fresh and vibrant, with a fine, taut, gossamer structure. A delicious Pinot Noir that's as elegant as it is refreshing and honest.
