Owned by Ken and Karen Wright, Savoya is planted on ancient marine sedimentary soil. Bold cherry fruit carries a streak of salinity, that tastes like a shake of salt and pepper around tart pomegranate fruit. It's tangy and lightly herbal, with classic structure and a clear path to aging over a decade or longer.
