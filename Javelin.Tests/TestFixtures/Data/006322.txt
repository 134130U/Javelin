From the tiny Faro denomination overlooking the Strait of Messina, this cult red opens with earthy aromas of tilled soil, leather, dried berry, smoke, savory herb and a hint of game. Displaying compelling earthy elegance, the palate offers black cherry, raspberry, tobacco, truffle, tobacco, soil, graphite and licorice. It's still young but impeccably balanced, with firm but fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. Hold for even more complexity. Drink 2018â€“2025.
