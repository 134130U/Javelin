This Syrah, which blends 11% Counoise, is all about darkness, offering baking spice, blueberry, roast lamb, thyme, and espresso notes on the nose. It hits the palate with creamy power, its acidic backbone bolstering the pleasing tannic softness, and shows dark berry, milk chocolate, charred beef, and crushed peppercorn flavors.
