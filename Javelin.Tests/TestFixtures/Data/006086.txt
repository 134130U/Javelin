In 2014 this vineyard designate has been further subdivided by clone. The Dijon 115 bottling brings a burst of fresh raspberry fruit, detailed and perfectly set against balancing acidity. It's still quite young, but has the polish and promise of further richness with additional bottle age. Drink 2020 through 2030.
