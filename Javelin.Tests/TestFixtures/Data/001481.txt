Aromas of perfumed berry, mint baking spice, toast and espresso waft out of the glass. The palate is tight and rather primary at the moment, showing raw black cherry, raspberry, clove and toasted notes. It's still young but balanced, with fresh acidity and firm, fine–grained tannins. Drink 2016–2022.
