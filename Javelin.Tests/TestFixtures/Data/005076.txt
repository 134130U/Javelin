Steve Clifton's music-inspired project heads to the Syrah-focused appellation of Ballard Canyon to produce this well-hewn bottling that kicks off with boysenberry, hibiscus, rose bud and white pepper aromas. Tart elderberry jam flavors meld with wild thyme and savory pepper spice on the complex palate, which culminates in a mouthwatering finish.
