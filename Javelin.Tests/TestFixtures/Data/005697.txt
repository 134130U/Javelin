A rewarding wine for its price, this bottling from winemaker Eric Johnson weaves accessible butter-crusted cherry pie and vanilla aromas with bright, nuanced touches of hibiscus, rose petal and mace on the nose. The palate unfolds in layers, mulberry and plum fruit giving way to crushed sage and roasted fennel notes, each as texturally compelling as the last.
