Harvested late but not sweet, this decadently rich and fruity wine pairs well with cheese or an equally opulent dish such as osso bucco or red wine risotto. It has grapey, jammy aromas and late-picked flavors like fig, plum and black raisin that glide along the palate. The alcohol is high, tempered by a velvety texture and moderate tannins.
