This single-vineyard bottling comes from Pinot Noir expert Norm Yost. Baking spices and cinnamon greet the nose, followed by sweet-tart boysenberry and freshly turned soil. On the palate, black licorice leads, followed by an impressively smooth, black cherry-laden midpalate, ending with tantalizing spices on the back end.
