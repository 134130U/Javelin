Earthy yet elegant, this was made mostly with Nerello Mascalese, Nerello Cappuccio and Nocera grown in steep vineyards above the Strait of Messina. Aromas recall freshly turned soil, red berry, leather and Mediterranean herb. The firm palate offers black cherry, crushed raspberry, game, licorice and clove along with a vein of smoky mineral. Well-integrated tannins provide support. Enjoy through 2021.
